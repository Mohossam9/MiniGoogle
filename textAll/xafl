 "O Persian!" I think it means more, a Persian
being generally considered "too clever by half."

[FN#15]  The verses deal in untranslatable word-plays upon
women's names, Naomi (the blessing) Su'adá or Su'ád (the happy,
which Mr. Redhouse, in Ka'ab's Mantle-poem, happily renders
Beatrice); and Juml (a sum or total) the two latter, moreover,
being here fictitious.

[FN#16]  "And he (Jacob) turned from them, and said, 'O how I am
grieved for Joseph' And his eyes became white with mourning. ...
(Quoth Joseph to his brethren), 'Take this my inner garment and
throw it on my father's face and he shall recover his sight.' . .
. So, when the messenger of good tidings came (to Jacob) he threw
it (the shirt) over his face and he recovered his eye-sight."
Koran, xii. 84, 93, 96. The commentators, by way of improvement,
assure us that the shirt was that worn by Abraham when thrown
into the fire (Koran, chaps. xvi.) by Nimrod (!). We know little
concerning "Jacob's daughters" who named the only bridge spanning
the upper Jordan, and who have a curious shrine tomb near Jewish
"Safe" (North of Tiberias), one of the four "Holy Cities." The
Jews ignore these "daughters of Jacob" and travellers neglect
them.

[FN#17]  Easterns, I have remarked, mostly recognise the artistic
truth that the animal-man is handsomer than woman and that "fair
sex" is truly only of skin-colour. The same is the general-rule
throughout creation, for instance the stallion compared with the
mare, the cock with the hen; while there are sundry exceptions
such as the Falconidae.

[FN#18]  The Badawi (who is nothing if not horsey) compares the
gait of a woman who walks well (in Europe rarely seen out of
Spain) with the slightly swinging walk of a thoroughbred mare,
bending her graceful neck and looking from side to side at
objects as she passes.

[FN#19]  Li'lláhi (darr') al-káil, a characteristic idiom.
"Darr"=giving (rich) milk copiously and the phrase expresses
admiration, "To Allah be ascribed (or Allah be praised for) his
rich eloquence who said etc. Some Hebraists would render it,
"Divinely (well) did he speak who said," etc., holding "Allah" to
express a superlative like "Yah" Jah) in Gen. iv. 1; x. 9. Nimrod
was a hunter to the person (or presence) of Yah, i.e. mighty
hunter.

[FN#20]  Hamzah and Abbás were the famous uncles of Mohammed
often noticed: Ukayl is not known; possibly it may be Akíl, a son
of the fourth Caliph, Ali.

[FN#21]  The Eastern ring is rarely plain; and, its use being
that of a signet, it is always in intaglio: the Egyptians
invented engraving hieroglyphics on wooden stamps for marking
bricks and applied the process to the ring. Moses B. C. 1491
(Exod. xxviii. 9) took two onyx-stones, and graved on them the
names of the children of Israel. From this the signet ring was
but a step. Herodotus mentions an emerald seal-set in gold, that
of Polycrates, the work of Theodorus, son of Telecles the Samian
(iii. 141). The Egyptians also were perfectly acquainted with
working in cameo (anaglyph) and rilievo, as may be seen in the
cavo rilievo of the finest of their hieroglyphs. The Greeks
borrowed from them the cameo and applied it to gems (e.g.
Tryphon's in the Marlborough collection), and they bequeathed the
art to the Romans. We read in a modern book "Cameo means an onyx,
and the most famous cameo in the world is the onyx containing the
Apotheosis of Augustus." The ring is given in marriage because it
was a seal--by which orders were signed (Gen. xxxviii. 18 and
Esther iii. 10-12). I may note that the seal-ring of Cheops
(Khufu), found in the Greatest Pyramid, was in the possession of
my old friend, Doctor Abbott, of Auburn (U.S.), and was sold with
his collection. It is the oldest ring in the world, and settles
the Cheops-question.

[FN#22]  This habit of weeping when friends meet after long
parting is customary, I have noted, amongst the American
"Indians," the Badawin of the New World; they shed tears thinking
of the friends they have lost. Like most primitive people they
are ever ready to weep as was Æneas or Shakespeare's saline
personage,

          "This would make a man, a man of salt
            To use his eyes for garden waterpots."
                                           (King Lear, iv. 6.)

[FN#23]  Here poetical-justice is not done; in most Arab tales
the two adulterous Queens would have been put to death.

[FN#24]  Pronounce Aladdin Abush-Shámát.

[FN#25]  Arab. "Misr," vulg. Masr: a close connection of Misraim
the "two Misrs," Egypt, upper and lower.

[FN#26]  The Persians still call their Consuls "Shah-bander,"
lit. king of the Bandar or port.

[FN#27]  Arab. "Dukhúl," the night of going in, of seeing the
bride unveiled for the first time, etcaetera.

[FN#28]  Arab. "Barsh" or "Bars," the commonest kind. In India it
is called Ma'jún (=electuary, generally): it is made of Ganja or
young leaves, buds, capsules and florets of hemp (C. saliva),
poppy-seed and flowers of the thorn-apple (daiura) with milk and
auger-candy, nutmegs, cloves, mace and saffron, all boiled to the
consistency of treacle which hardens when cold. Several-recipes
are given by Herklots (Glossary s.v. Majoon). These electuaries
are usually prepared with "Charas," or gum of hemp, collected by
hand or by passing a blanket over the plant in early morning, and
it is highly intoxicating. Another intoxicant is "Sabzi," dried
hemp-leaves, poppy-seed, cucumber heed, black pepper and
cardamoms rubbed down in a mortar with a wooden pestle, and made
drinkable by adding milk, ice-cream, etc. The Hashish of Arabia
is the Hindustani Bhang, usually drunk and made as follows. Take
of hemp-leaves, well washed, 3 drams black pepper 45 grains and
of cloves, nutmeg and mace (which add to the intoxication) each
12 grains. Triturate in 8 ounces of water or the juice of
watermelon or cucumber, strain and drink. The Egyptian Zabíbah is
a preparation of hemp florets, opium and honey, much affected by
the lower orders, whence the proverb: "Temper thy sorrow with
Zabibah. In Al-Hijaz it is mixed with raisins (Zabíb) and smoked
in the water-pipe. (Burck hardt No. 73.) Besides these there is
(1) "Post" poppy-seed prepared in various ways but especially in
sugared sherbets; (2) Datura (stramonium) seed, the produce of
the thorn-apple breached and put into sweetmeats by dishonest
confectioners; it is a dangerous intoxicant, producing
spectral-visions, delirium tremens, etc., and (3) various
preparations of opium especially the "Madad," pills made up with
toasted betel-leaf and smoked. Opium, however, is usually drunk
in the shape of "Kusumba," a pill placed in wet cotton and
squeezed in order to strain and clean it of the cowdung and other
filth with which it is adulterated.

[FN#29]  Arab. "Sikankúr" (Gr. {Greek letters}, Lat. Scincus) a
lizard (S. officinalis) which, held in the hand, still acts as an
aphrodisiac in the East, and which in the Middle Ages was
considered a universal-medicine. In the "Adja'ib al-Hind" (Les
Merveilles de l'Inde) we find a notice of a bald-headed old man
who was compelled to know his wife twice a day and twice a night
in consequence of having eaten a certain fish. (Chaps. Ixxviii.
of the translation by M. L. Marcel Devic, from a manuscript of
the tenth century, Paris Lemaire, 1878.) Europeans deride these
prescriptions, but Easterns know better: they affect the fancy,
that is the brain, and often succeed in temporarily relieving
impotence. The recipes for this evil, which is incurable only
when it comes from heart-affections, are innumerable in the East;
and about half of every medical-work is devoted to them. Many a
quack has made his fortune with a few bottles of tincture of
cantharides, and a man who could discover a specific would become
a millionaire in India only. The curious reader will consult for
specimens the Ananga-Ranga Shastra by Koka Pandit; or the "Rujú
'al-Shaykh ila 'l-Sabáh fi Kuwwati 'l-Báh" (the Return of the Old
Man to Youth in power of Procreation) by Ahmad bin Sulaymán known
as Ibn Kamál-Báshá, in 139 chapters lithographed at Cairo. Of
these aphrodisiacs I shall have more to say.

[FN#30]  Alá al-Din (our old friend Aladdin) = Glory of the
Faith, a name of which Mohammed who preferred the simplest, like
his own, would have highly disapproved. The most grateful names
to Allah are Abdallah (Allah's Slave) and Abd al-Rahman (Slave of
the Compassionate); the truest are Al-Hárith (the gainer, "bread
winner") and Al-Hammám (the griever); and the hatefullest are
Al-Harb (witch) and Al-Murrah (bitterness, Abu Murrah being a
kunyat or by-name of the Devil). Abu al-Shámát (pronounced
Abushshámát)=Father of Moles, concerning which I have already
given details. These names ending in -Din (faith) began with the
Caliph Al-Muktadi bi-Amri 'llah (regn. A.H. 467= 1075), who
entitled his Wazir "Zahír al-Din (Backer or Defender of the
Faith) and this gave rise to the practice. It may be observed
that the superstition of naming by omens is in no way obsolete.

[FN#31]  Meaning that he appeared intoxicated by the pride of his
beauty as though it had been strong wine.

[FN#32]   i.e. against the evil eye.

[FN#33]  Meaning that he had been delicately reared.

[FN#34]  A traditional-saying of Mohammed.

[FN#35]  So Boccaccio's "Capo bianco" and "Coda verde." (Day iv.,
Introduct.)

[FN#36]  The opening chapter is known as the "Mother of the Book"
(as opposed to Yá Sín, the "heart of the Koran"), the "Surat
(chapter) of Praise," and the "Surat of repetition" (because
twice revealed?) or thanksgiving, or laudation (Ai-Masáni) and by
a host of other names for which see Mr. Rodwell who, however,
should not write "Fatthah" (p. xxv.) nor "Fathah" (xxvii.). The
Fátihah, which is to Al-Islam much what the "Paternoster" is to
Christendom, consists of seven verses, in the usual-Saj'a or
rhymed prose, and I have rendered it as follows: 

In the name of the Compassionating, the Compassionate! * Praise
be to Allah who all the Worlds made * The Compassionating, the
Compassionate * King of the Day of Faith! * Thee only do we adore
and of Thee only do we crave aid * Guide us to the path which is
straight * The path of those for whom Thy love is great, not
those on whom is hate, nor they that deviate * Amen! O Lord of
the World's trine.

My Pilgrimage (i. 285; ii. 78 and passim) will supply instances
of its application; how it is recited with open hands to catch
the blessing from Heaven and the palms are drawn down the face
(Ibid. i. 286), and other details,

[FN#37]  i.e. when the evil eye has less effect than upon
children. Strangers in Cairo often wonder to see a woman richly
dressed leading by the hand a filthy little boy (rarely a girl)
in rags, which at home will be changed to cloth of gold.

[FN#38]  Arab. "Asídah" flour made consistent by boiling in water
with the addition of "Same" clarified butter) and honey: more
like pap than custard.

[FN#39]  Arab. "Ghábah" = I have explained as a low-lying place
where the growth is thickest and consequently animals haunt it
during the noon-heats

[FN#40]  Arab. "Akkám," one who loads camels and has charge of
the luggage. He also corresponds with the modern Mukharrij or
camel-hirer (Pilgrimage i. 339), and hence the word Moucre
(Moucres) which, first used by La Brocquière (A.D. 1432), is
still the only term known to the French.

[FN#41]  i.e. I am old and can no longer travel.

[FN#42]  Taken from Al-Asma'i, the "Romance of Antar," and the
episode of the Asafir Camels.

[FN#43]  A Mystic of the twelfth century A.D. who founded the
Kádirí order (the oldest and chiefest of the four universally
recognised), to which I have the honour to belong, teste my
diploma (Pilgrimage, Appendix i.). Visitation is still made to
his tomb at Baghdad. The Arabs (who have no hard g-letter) alter
to "Jílán" the name of his birth-place "Gilan," a tract between
the Caspian and the Black Seas.

[FN#44]  The well-known Anglo-Indian "Mucuddum;" lit. "one placed
before (or over) others"

[FN#45]  Koran xiii. 14.

[FN#46]  i.e.. his chastity: this fashion of objecting to
infamous proposals is very characteristic: ruder races would use
their fists.

[FN#47]  Arab. "Ráfizí"=the Shi'ah (tribe, sect) or Persian
schismatics who curse the first three Caliphs: the name is taken
from their own saying "Inná rafizná-hum"=verily we have rejected
them. The feeling between Sunni (the so-called orthodox) and
Shi'ah is much like the Christian love between a Catholic of Cork
and a Protestant from the Black North. As Al-Siyuti or any
historian will show, this sect became exceedingly powerful under
the later Abbaside Caliphs, many of whom conformed to it and
adopted its tractices and innovations (as in the Azan or
prayer-call), greatly to the scandal-of their co-religionists.
Even in the present day the hatred between these representatives
of Arab monotheism and Persian Guebrism continues unabated. I
have given sundry instances m my Pilgrimage, e.g. how the
Persians attempt to pollute the tombs of the Caliphs they abhor.

[FN#48]  Arab. "Sakká," the Indian "Bihishtí" (man from Heaven):
Each party in a caravan has one or more.

[FN#49]  These "Kirámát" or Saints' miracles, which Spiritualists
will readily accept, are recorded in vast numbers. Most men have
half a dozen to tell, each of his "Pír" or patron, including the
Istidráj or prodigy of chastisement. (Dabistan, iii. 274.)

[FN#50]  Great granddaughter of the Imam Hasan buried in Cairo
and famed for "Kirámát." Her father, governor of Al-Medinah, was
imprisoned by Al-Mansur and restored to power by Al-Mahdi. She
was married to a son of the Imam Ja'afar al-Sadik and lived a
life of devotion in Cairo, dying in A.H. 218=824. The corpse of
the Imam al-Shafi'i was carried to her house, now her mosque and
mausoleum: it stood in the Darb al-Sabúa which formerly divided
Old from New Cairo and is now one of the latter's suburbs. Lane
(M. E. chaps. x.) gives her name but little more. The mention of
her shows that the writer of the tale or the copyist was a
Cairene : Abd al-Kadir is world-known : not so the "Sitt."

[FN#51]  Arab. "Farkh akrab" for Ukayrib, a vulgarism.

[FN#52]  The usual Egyptian irreverence: he relates his
abomination as if it were a Hadis or Tradition of the Prophet
with due ascription.

[FN#53]  A popular name, dim. of Zubdah cream, fresh butter,
"creamkin."

[FN#54]  Arab. "Mustahall," "Mustahill' and vulg. "Muhallil"
(=one who renders lawful). It means a man hired for the purpose
who marries pro forma and after wedding, and bedding with
actual-consummation, at once divorces the woman. He is held the
reverse of respectable and no wonder. Hence, probably,
Mandeville's story of the Islanders who, on the marriage-night,
"make another man to lie by their wives, to have their
maidenhead, for which they give great hire and much thanks. And
there are certain men in every town that serve for no other
thing; and they call them cadeberiz, that is to say, the fools of
despair, because they believe their occupation is a dangerous
one." Burckhardt gives the proverb (No. 79), "A thousand lovers
rather than one Mustahall," the latter being generally some ugly
fellow picked up in the streets and disgusting to the wife who
must permit his embraces.

[FN#55]  This is a woman's oath. not used by men.

[FN#56]  Pronounced "Yá Sín" (chaps. xxxvi.) the "heart of the
Koran" much used for edifying recitation. Some pious Moslems in
Egypt repeat it as a Wazifah, or religious task, or as masses for
the dead, and all educated men know its 83 versets by rote.

[FN#57]  Arab. "Ál-Dáúd"=the family of David, i.e. David himself,
a popular idiom. The prophet's recitation of the "Mazámir"
(Psalter) worked miracles.

[FN#58]  There is a peculiar thickening of the voice in leprosy
which at once betrays the hideous disease.

[FN#59]   These lines have occurred in Night clxxxiii. I quote
Mr. Payne (in loco) by way of variety.

[FN#60]  Where the "Juzám" (leprosy, elephantiasis, morbus
sacrum, etc. etc.) is supposed first to show: the swelling would
alter the shape. Lane (ii. 267) translates "her wrist which was
bipartite."

[FN#61]  Arab. "Zakariyá" (Zacharias): a play upon the term
"Zakar"=the sign of "masculinity." Zacharias, mentioned in the
Koran as the educator of the Virgin Mary (chaps. iii.) and
repeatedly referred to (chaps. xix. etc.), is a well-known
personage amongst Moslems and his church is now the great
Cathedral-Mosque of Aleppo.

[FN#62]  Arab. " Ark al-Haláwat " = vein of sweetness.

[FN#63]  Arab. "Futúh," which may also mean openings, has before
occurred.

[FN#64]  i.e. four times without withdrawing.

[FN#65]  i.e. a correspondence of size, concerning which many
rules are given in the Ananga-Rangha Shastra which justly
declares that discrepancy breeds matrimonial-troubles.

[FN#66]  Arab. "Ghuráb al-Bayn"= raven of the waste or the
parting: hence the bird of Odin symbolises separation (which is
also called Al-bayn). The Raven (Ghurab = Heb. Oreb and Lat.
Corvus, one of the prehistoric words) is supposed to be seen
abroad earlier than any other bird; and it is entitled "Abu
Zajir," father of omens, because lucky when flying towards the
right and v.v. It is opposed in poetry to the (white) pigeon, the
emblem of union, peace and happiness. The vulgar declare that
when Mohammed hid in the cave the crow kept calling to his
pursuers, "Ghár! Ghár!" (cavern, cavern): hence the Prophet
condemned him to wear eternal-mourning and ever to repeat the
traitorous words. This is the old tale of Coronis and Apollo
(Ovid, lib. ii.).

         ----------" who blacked the raven o'er
         And bid him prate in his white plumes no more."

[FN#67]  This use of a Turkish title "Efendi" being=our esquire,
and inferior to a Bey, is a rank anachronism, probably of the
copyist.

[FN#68]  Arab. "Samn"=Hind. "Ghi" butter melted, skimmed and
allowed to cool.

[FN#69]  Arab. "Ya Wadúd," a title of the Almighty: the Mac.
Edit. has "O David!"

[FN#70]  Arab. "Muwashshahah;" a complicated stanza of which
specimens have occurred. Mr. Payne calls it a "ballad," which
would be a "Kunyat al-Zidd."

[FN#71]  Arab. "Baháim" (plur. of Bahímah=Heb. Behemoth), applied
in Egypt especially to cattle. A friend of the "Oppenheim" house,
a name the Arabs cannot pronounce was known throughout Cairo as
"Jack al-baháim" (of the cows).

[FN#72]  Lit. "The father of side-locks," a nickname of one of
the Tobba Kings. This "Hasan of: the ringlets" who wore two long
pig-tails hanging to his shoulders was the Rochester or Piron of
his age: his name is still famous for brilliant wit, extempore
verse and the wildest debauchery. D'Herbelot's sketch of his life
is very meagre. His poetry has survived to the present day and
(unhappily) we shall] hear more of "Abu Nowás." On the subject of
these patronymics Lane (Mod. Egypt, chaps. iv.) has a strange
remark that "Abu Dáúd i' not the Father of Dáúd or Abu Ali the
Father of Ali, but whose Father is (or was) Dáúd or Ali." Here,
however, he simply confounds Abu = father of (followed by a
genitive), with Abu-h (for Abu-hu) = he, whose father.

[FN#73]  Arab. "Samúr," applied in slang language to cats and dogs,
hence the witty Egyptians converted Admiral-Seymour (Lord Alcester)
into "Samúr."

[FN#74]  The home-student of Arabic may take this letter as a model
even in the present day; somewhat stiff and old-fashioned, but
gentlemanly and courteous.

[FN#75]  Arab. "Salím" (not Sé-lim) meaning the "Safe and sound."

[FN#76]  Arab. "Haláwah"=sweetmeat, meaning an entertainment such
as men give to their friends after sickness or a journey. it is
technically called as above, "The Sweetmeat of Safety."

[FN#77]  Arab. "Salát" which from Allah means mercy, from the
Angels intercession and pardon; and from mankind blessing.
Concerning the specific effects of blessing the Prophet, see
Pilgrimage (ii. 70). The formula is often slurred over when a man
is in a hurry to speak: an interrupting friend will say " Bless the
Prophet!" and he does so by ejaculating "Sa'am."

[FN#78]  Persian, meaning originally a command: it is now applied
to a Wazirial-order as opposed to the " Irádah," the Sultan's
order.

[FN#79]  Arab. " Mashá'ilí" lit. the cresses-bearer who has before
appeared as hangman.

[FN#80]  Another polite formula for announcing a death.

[FN#81]  As he died heirless the property lapsed to the Treasury.

[FN#82]This shaking the kerchief is a signal to disperse and the
action suggests its meaning. Thus it is used in an opposite sense
to "throwing the kerchief," a pseudo-Oriental practice whose
significance is generally understood in Europe.

[FN#83]  The body-guard being of two divisions.

[FN#84]  Arab. "Hadbá," lit. "hump-backed;" alluding to the Badawi
bier; a pole to which the corpse is slung (Lane). It seems to
denote the protuberance of the corpse when placed upon the bier
which before was flat. The quotation is from Ka'ab's Mantle-Poem
(Burdah v . 37), "Every son of a female, long though his safety may
be, is a day borne upon a ridged implement," says Mr. Redhouse,
explaining the latter as a "bier with a ridged lid." Here we
differ: the Janázah with a lid is not a Badawi article: the
wildlings use the simplest stretcher; and I would translate the
lines,

          "The son of woman, whatso his career
           One day is borne upon the gibbous bier."

[FN#85]  This is a high honour to any courtier.

[FN#86]  "Khatun" in Turk. means any lady: mistress, etc., and
follows the name, e.g. Fátimah Khatun. Habzalam Bazazah is supposed
to be a fanciful compound, uncouth as the named; the first word
consisting of "Habb" seed, grain; and "Zalam" of Zulm=seed of
tyranny. Can it be a travesty of "Absalom" (Ab Salám, father of
peace)? Lane (ii. 284) and Payne (iii. 286) prefer Habazlam and
Hebezlem.

[FN#87]  Or night. A metaphor for rushing into peril.

[FN#88]  Plur. of kumkum, cucurbite, gourd-shaped vessel, jar.

[FN#89]  A popular exaggeration for a very expert thief.

[FN#90]  Arab. "Buka'at Ad-bum": lit. the "low place of blood"
(where it stagnates): so Al-Buká'ah = Cœlesyria.

[FN#91]  That common and very unpleasant phrase, full of egotism
and self-esteem, "I told you so," is even more common in the naïve
East than in the West. In this case the son's answer is far
superior to the mother's question.

[FN#92]  In order to keep his oath to the letter.

[FN#93]  "Tabannuj; " literally "hemping" (drugging with hemp or
henbane) is the equivalent in Arab medicine of our "anæsthetics."
These have been used in surgery throughout the East for centuries
before ether and chloroform became the fashion in the civilised
West.

[FN#94]  Arab. "Durká'ah," the lower part of the floor, opposed to
the "liwán" or daïs. Liwán =Al-Aywán (Arab. and Pers.) the hall
(including the daïs and the sunken parts)

[FN#95]  i.e. he would toast it as he would a mistress.

[FN#96]  This till very late years was the custom in Persia, and
Fath Ali Shah never appeared in scarlet without ordering some
horrible cruelties. In Dar-For wearing a red cashmere turban was a
sign of wrath and sending a blood red dress to a subject meant that
he would be slain.

[FN#97]  That is, this robbery was committed in the palace by some
one belonging to it. References to vinegar are frequent; that of
Egypt being famous in those days. "Optimum et laudatissimum acetum
a Romanis habebatur Ægyptum" (Facciolati); and possibly it was
sweetened: the Gesta (Tale xvii.) mentions "must and vinegar." In
Arab Proverbs, One mind by vinegar and another by wine"=each mind
goes its own way, (Arab. Prov. . 628); or, "with good and bad,"
vinegar being spoilt wine.

[FN#98]  We have not heard the last of this old "dowsing rod": the
latest form of rhabdomancy is an electrical-rod invented in the
United States.

[FN#99]  This is the procès verbal always drawn up on such
occasions.

[FN#100]  The sight of running water makes a Persian long for
strong drink as the sight of a fine view makes the Turk feel
hungry.

[FN#101]  Arab. "Min wahid aduww " a peculiarly Egyptian or rather
Cairene phrase.

[FN#102]  Al-Danaf=the Distressing Sickness: the title would be
Ahmad the Calamity. Al-Zaybak (the Quicksilver)=Mercury Ali Hasan
"Shuuman"=a pestilent fellow. We shall meet all these worthies
again and again: see the Adventures of Mercury Ali of Cairo, Night
dccviii., a sequel to The Rogueries of Dalilah, Night dcxcviii.

[FN#103]  For the "Sacrifice-place of Ishmael" (not Isaac) see my
Pilgrimage (iii. 306). According to all Arab ideas Ishmael, being
the eldest son, was the chief of the family after his father. I
have noted that this is the old old quarrel between the Arabs and
their cousins the Hebrews.

[FN#104]  This black-mail was still paid to the Badawin of Ramlah
(Alexandria) till the bombardment in 1881.

[FN#105]  The famous Issus of Cilicia, now a port-village on the
Gulf of Scanderoon.

[FN#106]  Arab. " Wada'á" = the concha veneris, then used as small
change.

[FN#107]  Arab. "Sakati"=a dealer in "castaway" articles, such es
old metal,damaged goods, the pluck and feet of animals, etc.

[FN#108]  The popular tale of Burckhardt's death in Cairo was that
the names of the three first Caliphs were found written upon his
slipper-soles and that he was put to death by decree of the Olema.
It is the merest nonsense, as the great traveller died of dysentery
in the house of my old friend John Thurburn and was buried outside
the Bab al-Nasr of Cairo where his tomb was restored by the late
Rogers Bey (Pilgrimage i. 123).

[FN#109]  Prob. a mis-spelling for Arslán, in Turk. a lion, and in
slang a piastre.

[FN#110]  Arab. "Maka'ad;" lit. = sitting-room.

[FN#111]  Arab. "Khammárah"; still the popular term throughout
Egypt for a European Hotel. It is not always intended to be
insulting but it is, meaning the place where Franks meet to drink
forbidden drinks.

[FN#112]  A reminiscence of Mohammed who cleansed the Ka'abah of
its 360 idols (of which 73 names are given by Freytag, Einleitung,
etc. pp. 270, 342-57) by touching them with his staff, whereupon
all fell to the ground; and the Prophet cried (Koran xvii. 84),
"Truth is come, and falsehood is vanished: verily, falsehood is a
thing that vanisheth" (magna est veritas, etc.). Amongst the
"idols" are said to have been a statue of Abraham and the horns of
the ram sacrificed in lieu of Ishmael, which (if true) would prove
conclusively that the Abrahamic legend at Meccah is of ancient date
and not a fiction of Al-Islam. Hence, possibly, the respect of the
Judaising Tobbas of Hiwyarland for the Ka'abah. (Pilgrimage, iii.
295.)

[FN#113]  This was evidently written by a Sunni as the Shí'ahs
claim to be the only true Moslems. Lane tells an opposite story
(ii. 329). It suggests the common question in the South of Europe,
"Are you a Christian or a Protestant?"

[FN#114]  Arab. "Ana fí jírat-ak!" a phrase to be remembered as
useful in time of danger.

[FN#115]  i.e. No Jinni, or Slave of the Jewel, was there to
answer.

[FN#116]  Arab. "Kunsúl" (pron. "Gunsul") which here means a
well-to-do Frank, and shows the modern date of the tale as it
stands.

[FN#117]  From the Ital. "Capitano." The mention of cannon and
other terms in this tale shows that either it was written during
the last century or it has been mishandled by copyists.

[FN#118]  Arab. "Minínah"; a biscuit of flour and clarified butter.

[FN#119]  Arab. "Waybah"; the sixth part of the Ardabb=6 to 7
English gallons.

[FN#120]  He speaks in half-jest à la fellah; and reminds us of
"Hangman, drive on the cart!"

[FN#121]  Yochanan (whom Jehovah has blessed) Jewish for John, is
probably a copy of the Chaldean Euahanes, the Oannes of Berosus=Ea
Khan, Hea the fish. The Greeks made it Joannes; the Arabs "Yohanná"
(contracted to "Hanná," Christian) and "Yábyá" (Moslem). Prester
(Priest) John is probably Ung Khan, the historian prince conquered
and slain by Janghiz Khan in A.D. 1202. The modern history of
"John" is very extensive: there may be a full hundred varieties and
derivation' of the name. "Husn Maryam" the beauty (spiritual. etc.)
of the B.V.

[FN#122]  Primarily being middle-aged; then aid, a patron, servant,
etc. Also a tribe of the Jinn usually made synonymous with "Márid,"
evil controuls, hostile to men: modern spiritualists would regard
them as polluted souls not yet purged of their malignity. The text
insinuates that they were at home amongst Christians and in Genoa.

[FN#123]  Arab. "Sar'a" = epilepsy, falling sickness, of old always
confounded with "possession" (by evil spirits) or "obsession."

[FN#124]  Again the true old charge of falsifying the so-called
"Sacred books." Here the Koran is called "Furkán." Sale (sect.
iii.) would assimilate this to the Hebr. "Perek" or "Pirka,"
denoting a section or portion of Scripture; but Moslems understand
it to be the "Book which distinguisheth (faraka, divided) the true
from the false." Thus Caliph Omar was entitled "Fárúk" = the
Distinguisher (between right and wrong). Lastly, "Furkán," meanings
as in Syr. and Ethiop. deliverance, revelation, is applied alike to
the Pentateuch and Koran.

[FN#125]  Euphemistic for "thou shalt die."

[FN#126]  Lit. "From (jugular) vein to vein" (Arab. "Waríd"). Our
old friend Lucretius again: "Tantane relligio," etc.

[FN#127]  As opposed to the "but" or outer room.

[FN#128]  Arab. "Darb al-Asfar" in the old Jamalíyah or Northern
part of Cairo.

[FN#129]  A noble tribe of Badawin that migrated from Al-Yaman and
settled in Al-Najd Their Chief, who died a few years before
Mohammed's birth, was Al-Hatim (the "black crow"), a model of Arab
manliness and munificence; and although born in the Ignorance he
will enter Heaven with the Moslems. Hatim was buried on the hill
called Owárid: I have already noted this favourite practice of the
wilder Arabs and the affecting idea that the Dead may still look
upon his kith and kin. There is not an Arab book nor, indeed, a
book upon Arabia which does not contain the name of Hatim: he is
mentioned as unpleasantly often as Aristides.

[FN#130]  Lord of "Cattle-feet," this King's name is unknown; but
the Kámús mentions two Kings called Zu 'l Kalá'a, the Greater and
the Less. Lane's Shaykh (ii. 333) opined that the man who demanded
Hatim's hospitality was one Abu'l-Khaybari.

[FN#131]  The camel's throat, I repeat, is not cut as in the case
of other animals, the muscles being too strong: it is slaughtered
by the "nahr," i.e. thrusting a knife into the hollow at the
commissure of the chest. (Pilgrimage iii. 303.)

[FN#132]  Adi became a Moslem and was one of the companions of the
Prophet.

[FN#133]  A rival-in generosity to Hatim: a Persian poet praising
his patron's generosity says that it buried that of Hatim and
dimmed that of Ma'an (D'Herbelot). He was a high official-under the
last Ommiade, Marwán al-Himár (the "Ass," or the "Century," the
duration of Ommiade rule) who was routed and slain in A.H. 132=750.
Ma'an continued to serve under the Abbasides and was a favourite
with Al-Mansúr. "More generous or bountiful than Ka'ab" is another
saying (A. P., i. 325); Ka'ab ibn Mámah was a man who, somewhat
like Sir Philip Sidney at Zutphen, gave his own portion of drink
while he was dying of thirst to a man who looked wistfully at him,
whence the saying "Give drink to thy brother the Námiri" (A. P., i.
608). Ka'ab could not mount, so they put garments over him to scare
away the wild beasts and left him in the desert to die. "Scatterer
of blessings" (Náshir al-Ni'am) was a title of King Malik of
Al-Yaman, son of Sharhabíl, eminent for his liberality. He set up
the statue in the Western Desert, inscribed "Nothing behind me," as
a warner to others.

[FN#134]  Lane (ii. 352) here introduces, between Nights cclxxi.
and ccxc., a tale entitled in the Bresl. Edit. (iv. 134) "The
Sleeper and the Waker," i.e. the sleeper awakened; and he calls it:
The Story of Abu-l-Hasan the Wag. It is interesting and founded
upon historical-fact; but it can hardly be introduced here without
breaking the sequence of The Nights. I regret this the more as Mr.
Alexander J. Cotheal-of New York has most obligingly sent me an
addition to the Breslau text (iv. 137) from his MS. But I hope
eventually to make use of it.

[FN#135]  The first girl calls gold "Titer" (pure, unalloyed
metal); the second "Asjad" (gold generally) and the third "Ibríz"
(virgin ore, the Greek {Greek letters}. This is a law of Arab
rhetoric never to repeat the word except for a purpose and, as the
language can produce 1,200,000 (to 100,000 in English) the
copiousness is somewhat painful to readers.

[FN#136]  Arab. "Shakes" before noticed.

[FN#137]  Arab. "Kussá'á"=the curling cucumber: the vegetable is of
the cheapest and the poorer classes eat it as "kitchen" with bread.

[FN#138]  Arab. "Haram-hu," a double entendre. Here the Barlawi
means his Harem the inviolate part of the house; but afterwards he
makes it mean the presence of His Honour.

[FN#139]  Toledo? this tale was probably known to Washington
Irving. The "Land of Roum " here means simply Frank-land as we are
afterwards told that its name was Andalusia the old Vandal-land, a
term still applied by Arabs to the whole of the Iberian Peninsula.

[FN#140]  Arab. "Amáim" (plur. of Imámah) the common word for
turband which I prefer to write in the old unclipt fashion. We got
it through the Port. Turbante and the old French Tolliban from the
(now obsolete) Persian term Dolband=a turband or a sash.

[FN#141]  Sixth Ommiade Caliph, A.D. 705-716, from "Tárik" we have
"Gibraltar"=Jabal-al-Tárik.

[FN#142]  Arab. "Yunán" = Ionia, applied to ancient Greece as
"Roum" is to the Græco-Roman Empire.

[FN#143]  Arab. "Bahramáni ;" prob. alluding to the well-known
legend of the capture of Somanath (Somnauth) from the Hindus by
Mahmud of Ghazni. In the Ajá'ib al-Hind (before quoted) the
Brahmins are called Abrahamah.

[FN#144]  i.e. "Peace be with thee!"

[FN#145]  i.e. in the palace when the hunt was over. The bluntness
and plain-speaking of the Badawi, which caused the revelation of
the Koranic chapter "Inner Apartments" (No. xlix.) have always been
favourite themes with Arab tale-tellers as a contrast with citizen
suavity and servility. Moreover the Badawi, besides saying what he
thinks, always tells the truth (unless corrupted by commerce with
foreigners); and this is a startling contrast with the townsfolk.
To ride out of Damascus and have a chat with the Ruwalá is much
like being suddenly transferred from amongst the trickiest of
Mediterranean people to the bluff society of the Scandinavian
North. And the reason why the Turk will never govern the Arab in
peace is that the former is always trying to finesse and to succeed
by falsehood, when the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the
truth is wanted.

[FN#146]  Koran. xvi. 112.

[FN#147]  A common and expressive way of rewarding the tongue which
"spoke poetry." The Jewels are often pearls.

[FN#148]  Ibrahim Abu Ishák bin al-Mahdi, a pretender to the
Caliphate of well known wit and a famed musician surnamed from his
corpulence "Al-Tannín"=the Dragon or, according to others (Lane ii.
336), "Al-Tin"= the fig. His adventurous history will be found in
Ibn Khallikan D'Herbelot and Al-Siyuti.

[FN#149]  The Ragha of the Zendavesta, and Rages of the Apocrypha
(Tobit, Judith, etc.), the old capital-of Media Proper, and seat of
government of Daylam, now a ruin some miles south of Teheran which
was built out of its remains. Rayy was founded by Hoshang the
primeval-king who first sawed wood, made doors and dug metal. It is
called Rayy al-Mahdiyyah because Al-Mahdi held his court there.
Harun al-Rashid was also born in it (A.H. 145). It is mentioned by
a host of authors and names one of the Makamat of Al-Hariri.

[FN#150]  Human blood being especially impure.

[FN#151]  Jones, Brown and Robinson.

[FN#152]  Arab. "Kumm ," the Moslem sleeve is mostly (like his
trousers) of ample dimensions and easily converted into a kind of
carpet-bag by depositing small articles in the middle and gathering
up the edge in the hand. In this way carried the weight would be
less irksome than hanging to the waist. The English of Queen Anne's
day had regular sleeve-pockets for memoranda, etc., hence the
saying, to have in one's sleeve.

[FN#153]  Arab. "Khuff" worn under the "Bábúg" (a corruption of the
Persian pá-push=feet-covers, papooshes, slippers). [Lane M. E.
chaps. i.]

[FN#154]  Done in hot weather throughout the city, a dry line for
camels being left in mid-street to prevent the awkward beasts
slipping. The watering of the Cairo streets of late years has been
excessive; they are now lines of mud in summer as well as in winter
and the effluvia from the droppings of animals have, combined with
other causes, seriously deteriorated the once charming climate. The
only place in Lower Egypt, which has preserved the atmosphere of
1850, is Suez.


[FN#155]  Arab. "Hurák:" burnt rag, serving as tinder for flint and
steel, is a common styptic.

[FN#156]  Of this worthy, something has been said and there will be
more in a future page.

[FN#157]  i.e. the person entitled to exact the blood-wite.

[FN#158]  Al-Maamum was a man of sense with all his fanaticism One
of his sayings is preserved "Odious is contentiousness in Kings,
more odious vexation in judges uncomprehending a case; yet more
odious is shallowness of doctors in religions and most odious are
avarice in the rich, idleness in youth, jesting in age and
cowardice in the soldier."

[FN#159]  The second couplet is not in the Mac. Edit. but Lane's
Shaykh has supplied it (ii. 339)

[FN#160]  Adam's loins, the "Day of Alast," and the Imam (who
stands before the people in prayer) have been explained. The
"Seventh Imam" here is Al-Maamun, the seventh Abbaside the Ommiades
being, as usual, ignored.

[FN#161]  He sinned only for the pleasure of being pardoned, which
is poetical-and hardly practical-or probable.

[FN#162]  The Katá (sand-grouse) always enters into Arab poetry
because it is essentially a desert bird, and here the comparison is
good because it lays its eggs in the waste far from water which it
must drink morning and evening. Its cry is interpreted "man sakat,
salam" (silent and safe), but it does not practice that precept,
for it is usually betrayed by its piping " Kata! Kata!" Hence the
proverb, "More veracious than the sand-grouse," and "speak not
falsely, for the Kata sayeth sooth," is Komayt's saying. It is an
emblem of swiftness: when the brigand poet Shanfara boasts, "The
ash-coloured Katas can drink only my leavings, after hastening all
night to slake their thirst in the morning," it is a hyperbole
boasting of his speed. In Sind it is called the "rock pigeon" and
it is not unlike a grey partridge when on the wing.

[FN#163]  Joseph to his brethren, Koran, xii. 92, when he gives
them his "inner garment" to throw over his father's face.

[FN#164]  Arab. "Hajjám"=a cupper who scarifies forehead and legs,
a bleeder, a (blood-) sucker. The slang use of the term is to
thrash, lick, wallop. (Burckhardt. Prov. 34.)

[FN#165]  The Bresl. Edit. (vii. 171-174) entitles this tale,
"Story of Shaddád bin Ad and the City of Iram the Columned ;" but
it relates chiefly to the building by the King of the First Adites
who, being promised a future Paradise by Prophet Húd, impiously
said that he would lay out one in this world. It also quotes Ka'ab
al-Ahbár as an authority for declaring that the tale is in the
"Pentateuch of Moses." Iram was in al-Yaman near Adan (our Aden) a
square of ten parasangs (or leagues each= 18,000 feet) every way,
the walls were of red (baked) brick 500 cubits high and 20 broad,
with four gates of corresponding grandeur. It contained 300,000
Kasr (palaces) each with a thousand pillars of gold-bound jasper,
etc. (whence its title). The whole was finished in five hundred
years, and, when Shaddad prepared to enter it, the "Cry of Wrath"
from the Angel of Death slew him and all his many. It is mentioned
in the Koran (chaps. Ixxxix. 6-7) as "Irem adorned with lofty
buildings (or pillars)." But Ibn Khaldun declares that commentators
have embroidered the passage; Iram being the name of a powerful
clan of the ancient Adites and "imád" being a tent-pole: hence
"Iram with the numerous tents or tent-poles." Al-Bayzawi tells the
story of Abdullah ibn Kilabah (D'Herbelot's Colabah). At Aden I met
an Arab who had seen the mysterious city on the borders of
Al-Ahkáf, the waste of deep sands, west of Hadramaut; and probably
he had, the mirage or sun-reek taking its place. Compare with this
tale "The City of Brass" (Night dlxv.).

[FN#166]  The biblical-"Sheba," named from the great-grandson of
Joctan, whence the Queen (Bilkis) visited Solomon It was destroyed
by the Flood of Márib.

[FN#167]  The full title of the Holy City is "Madinat al-Nab)" =
the City of the Prophet, of old Yasrib (Yathrib) the Iatrippa of
the Greeks (Pilgrimage, ii. 119). The reader will remember that
there are two "Yasribs:" that of lesser note being near Hujr in the
Yamámah province.

[FN#168]  "Ka'ab of the Scribes," a well-known traditionist and
religious poet who died (A.H. 32) in the Caliphate of Osman. He was
a Jew who islamised; hence his name (Ahbár, plur. of Hibr, a Jewish
scribe, doctor of science, etc. Jarrett's El-Siyuti, p. 123). He
must not be confounded with another Ka'ab al-Ahbár the Poet of the
(first) Cloak-poem or "Burdah," a noble Arab who was a distant
cousin of Mohammed, and whose tomb at Hums (Emesa) is a place of
pious visitation. According to the best authorities (no Christian
being allowed to see them) the cloak given to the bard by Mohammed
is still preserved together with the Khirkah or Sanjak Sherif
("Holy Coat" or Banner, the national oriflamme) at Stambul in the
Upper Seraglio. (Pilgrimage, i. 213.) Many authors repeat this
story of Mu'awiyah, the Caliph, and Ka'ab of the Burdah, but it is
an evident anachronism, the poet having been dead nine years before
the ruler's accession (A.H. 41).

[FN#169]  Koran, lxxxix. 6-7.

[FN#170]  Arab. "Kahramán" from Pers., braves, heroes.

[FN#171]  The Deity in the East is as whimsical-a despot as any of
his "shadows" or "vice regents." In the text Shaddád is killed for
mere jealousy a base passion utterly unworthy of a godhead; but one
to which Allah was greatly addicted.

[FN#172]  Some traditionist, but whether Sha'abi, Shi'abi or
Shu'abi we cannot decide.

[FN#173]  The Hazarmaveth of Genesis (x. 26) in South Eastern
Arabia. Its people are the Adramitae (mod. Hazrami) of Ptolemy who
places in their land the Arabiæ Emporium, as Pliny does his
Massola. They border upon the Homeritæ or men of Himyar, often
mentioned in The Nights. Hazramaut is still practically unknown to
us, despite the excursions of many travellers; and the hard nature
of the people, the Swiss of Arabia, offers peculiar obstacles to
exploration.

[FN#174]  i.e. the prophet Hud generally identified (?) with Heber.
He was commissioned (Koran, chaps. vii.) to preach Al-Islam to his
tribe the Adites who worshipped four goddesses, Sákiyah (the
rain-giver), Rázikah (food-giver), Háfizah (the saviouress) and
Sálimah (who healed sickness). As has been seen he failed, so it
was useless to send him.

[FN#175]  Son of Ibraham al-Mosili, a musician poet and favourite
with the Caliphs Harun al-Rashid and Al-Maamun. He made his name
immortal-by being the first who reduced Arab harmony to systematic
rules, and he wrote a biography of musicians referred to by
Al-Hariri in the Séance of Singar.

[FN#176]  This must not be confounded with the "pissing against the
wall" of I Kings, xiv. 10, where watering against a wall denotes a
man as opposed to a woman.

[FN#177]  Arab. "Zambíl" or "Zimbíl," a limp basket made of plaited
palm-leaves and generally two handled. It is used for many
purposes, from carrying poultry to carrying earth.

[FN#178]  Here we have again the Syriac ''Bakhkh
-un-Bakhkh-un-''=well done! It is the Pers Áferín and means "all
praise be to him."

[FN#179]  Arab. "A Tufayli?" So the Arab. Prov. (ii. 838) "More
intrusive than Tufayl" (prob. the P.N. of a notorious sponger). The
Badawin call "Wárish" a man who sits down to meat unbidden and to
drink Wághil; but townsfolk apply the latter to the "Wárish."

[FN#180]  Arab. "Artál"=rotoli, pounds; and

               "A pint is a pound
                All the world round;"

except in highly civilised lands where the pint has a curious power
of shrinking.

[FN#181]  One of Al-Maamun's Wazirs. The Caliph married his
daughter whose true name was Búrán; but this tale of girl's freak
and courtship was invented (?) by Ishak. For the splendour of the
wedding and the munificence of the Minister see Lane, ii. 350-352.

[FN#182]  I have described this scene, the wretch clinging to the
curtain and sighing and crying as if his heart would break
(Pilgrimage iii. 216 and 220). The same is done at the place
Al-Multazam'"the attached to;" (ibid. 156) and various spots called
Al-Mustajáb, "where prayer is granted" (ibid. 162). At Jerusalem
the Wailing place of the Jews" shows queer scenes; the worshippers
embrace the wall with a peculiar wriggle crying out in Hebrew, "O
build Thy House, soon, without delay," etc.

[FN#183]  i.e. The wife. The scene in the text was common at Cairo
twenty years ago; and no one complained of the stick. See
Pilgrimage i., 120.

[FN#184]  Arab. "Udm, Udum" (plur. of Idám) = "relish," olives,
cheese, pickled cucumbers, etc.

[FN#185]  I have noticed how the left hand is used in the East. In
the second couplet we have "Istinjá"=washing the fundament after
stool. The lines are highly appropriate for a nightman. Easterns
have many foul but most emphatic expressions like those in the text
I have heard a mother say to her brat, "I would eat thy merde!"
(i.e. how I love thee!).

[FN#186]  Arab. "Harrák," whence probably our "Carack" and
"Carrack" (large ship), in dictionaries derived from Carrus
Marinus.

[FN#187]  Arab. "Gháshiyah"=lit. an étui, a cover; and often a
saddle-cover carried by the groom.

[FN#188]  Arab. "Sharáb al-tuffáh" = melapio or cider.

[FN#189]  Arab. "Mudawwarah," which generally means a small round
cushion, of the Marocco-work well known in England. But one does
not strike a cushion for a signal, so we must revert to the
original-sense of the word "something round," as a circular plate
of wood or metal, a gong, a "bell" like that of the Eastern
Christians.

[FN#190]  Arab. "Túfán" (from the root tauf, going round) a storm,
a circular gale, a cyclone the term universally applied in Al-lslam
to the "Deluge," the "Flood" of Noah. The word is purely Arabic;
with a quaint likeness to the Gr. {Greek letters}, in Pliny typhon,
whirlwind, a giant (Typhœus) whence "Typhon" applied to the great
Egyptian god "Set." The Arab word extended to China and was given
to the hurricanes which the people call "Tee foong," great winds,
a second whimsical-resemblance. But Sir John Davis (ii. 383) is
hardly correct when he says, "the name typhoon, in itself a
corruption of the Chinese term, bears a singular (though we must
suppose an accidental) resemblance to the Greek {Greek letters}. "

[FN#191]  Plurale majestatis acting superlative; not as Lane
supposes (ii. 224) "a number of full moons, not only one." Eastern
tongues abound in instances beginning with Genesis (i. 1), "Gods
(he) created the heaven," etc. It is still preserved in Badawi
language and a wildling greatly to the astonishment of the citizens
will address his friend "Yá Rijál"= O men!

[FN#192]  Arab. "Hásid" = an envier: in the fourth couplet "Azúl"
(Azzál, etc.) = a chider, blamer; elsewhere "Lawwám" = accuser,
censor, slanderer; "Wáshí,"=whisperer, informer; "Rakib"=spying,
envious rival; "Ghábit"=one emulous without envy; and "Shámit"= a
"blue" (fierce) enemy who rejoices over another's calamities.
Arabic literature abounds in allusions to this unpleasant category
of "damned ill-natured friends;" and Spanish and Portuguese
letters, including Brazilian, have thoroughly caught the trick. In
the Eastern mind the "blamer" would be aided by the "evil eye."

[FN#193]  Another plural for a singular, "O my beloved!"

[FN#194]  Arab. "Khayr"=good news, a euphemistic reply even if the
tidings be of the worst.

[FN#195]  Abbás (from 'Abs, being austere; and meaning the "grim
faced") son of Abd al-Muttalib; uncle to Mohammed and eponym of the
Abbaside Khalifahs. A.D. 749=1258.

[FN#196]  Katíl = the Irish "kilt."

[FN#197]  This hat been explained as a wazirial title of the time.

[FN#198]  The phrase is intelligible in all tongues: in Arabic it
is opposed to "dark as night," "black as mud" and a host of
unsavoury antitheses.

[FN#199]  Arab. "Awwádah," the popular word; not Udíyyah as in
Night cclvi. "Ud" liter.= rood and "Al-Ud"=the wood is, I have
noted, the origin of our 'lute." The Span. 'laud" is larger and
deeper than the guitar, and its seven strings are played upon with
a plectrum of buffalo-horn.

[FN#200]  Arab. "Tabban lahu!"=loss (or ruin) to him. So "bu'dan
lahu"=away with him, abeat in malam rem; and "Suhkan lahu"=Allah
and mercy be far from him, no hope for him I

[FN#201]  Arab. "Áyah"=Koranic verses, sign, miracle.

[FN#202]  The mole on cheek calls to prayers for his preservation;
and it is black as Bilal the Abyssinian. Fajran may here mean
either "A.-morning" or "departing from grace."

[FN#203]  i.e. the  young beard (myrtle) can never hope to excel
tile beauties of his cheeks (roses).

[FN#204]  i.e. Hell and Heaven.

[FN#205]  The first couplet is not in the Mac. Edit. (ii. 171)
which gives only a single couplet but it is found in the Bres.
Edit. which entitles this tale "Story of the lying (or false kázib)
Khalífah." Lane (ii. 392) of course does not translate it.

[FN#206]  In the East cloth of frieze that mates with cloth of gold
must expect this treatment. Fath Ali Shah's daughters always made
their husbands enter the nuptial-bed by the foot end.

[FN#207]  This is always done and for two reasons; the first
humanity, that the blow may fall unawares; and, secondly, to
prevent the sufferer wincing, which would throw out the headsman.

[FN#208]  Arab. "Ma'áni-há," lit. her meanings, i.e. her inner
woman opposed to the formal-seen by every one.

[FN#209]  Described in my Pilgrimage (iii. 168, 174 and 175): it is
the stone upon which the Patriarch stood when he built the Ka'abah
and is said to show the impress of the feet but unfortunately I
could not afford five dollars entrance-fee. Caliph Omar placed the
station where it now is; before his time it adjoined the Ka'abah.
The meaning of the text is, Be thy court a place of pious
visitation, etc. At the "Station of Abraham" prayer is especially
blessed and expects to be granted. "This is the place where Abraham
stood; and whoever entereth therein shall be safe" (Koran ii. 119).
For the other fifteen places where petitions are favourably heard
by Heaven see ibid. iii. 211-12.

[FN#210]  As in the West, so in the East, women answer an
unpleasant question by a counter question.

[FN#211]  This "Cry of Haro" often occurs throughout The Nights. In
real-life it is sure to colece a crowd. especially if an Infidel
(non Moslem) be its cause.

[FN#212]  In the East a cunning fellow always makes himself the
claimant or complainant.

[FN#213]  On the Euphrates some 40 miles west of Baghdad The word
is written "Anbár" and pronounced "Ambár" as usual with the "n"
before "b"; the case of the Greek double Gamma.

[FN#214]  Syene on the Nile.

[FN#215]  The tale is in the richest Rabelaisian humour; and the
