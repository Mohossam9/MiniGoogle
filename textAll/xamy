Belgium and America




It would be a banality to speak about the gratitude of the Belgian
people toward America.  Every one knows from the beginning of the
war that when the Belgians were faced with starvation, it was the
American Commission for Relief which saved the situation, forming
all over the country, in America and elsewhere, those Committees
who collected the funds raised to help the Belgians, and saw that
they reached the proper channel and were utilized to the best
advantage of the Belgian people.

But helping to feed the people was not enough.  The Americans did
more.  They gave their heart.  Every one of them who came into
my country to act as a volunteer for the Commission for Relief,
brought with him the sympathy of all the people that were behind
him.  Every one of these young Americans, who, under the leadership
of Mr. Hoover, came into my country to watch the distribution of the
foodstuffs imported by the Commission for Relief, became a sincere
friend of my countrymen.  He stood between us and the Germans as a
vigilant sentry of the civilized world, and was able to tell when
he returned to America all the sufferings and all the courage of
the Belgian population.

I remember traveling in America some ten years ago, and being
asked, while I was reading a Belgian paper, where this paper came
from and when I answered "It came from Belgium, the next question
was:  "Belgium?  It is a province of France, isn't it?"  Now  I
do not think that any person in America, nor in any other part of
the world, will not know where Belgium is.

The American Commission for Relief has to be credited with putting
in closer contact the suffering population of my country with all
persons the world over who were eager to assist it.  It especially
brought the sufferings of our people nearer to the heart of the
American population.  Every one knows that.  But what every one does
not know is the silent and effective work performed in Belgium by
Mr. Brand Whitlock, the American Minister.  He was the real man at
the right place and at the right hour.  No one could have better
than he, with his deep humanitarian feeling, been able to understand
the moral side of the sufferings of the Belgians under the German
occupation.  No one could better than he find, at the very moment
when they were needed, the words appropriate to meet the circumstances,
and to convey to the people of this stricken country the feelings
which Mr. Whitlock knew were beating in the hearts of all Americans.

When the German authorities forbade the display of the Belgian Flag,
and the Tri-Color so dear to our hearts had to be hauled down, the
American Flag everywhere took its place.  Washington's birthday and
Independence Day were almost as solemn festivities to the Brussels
people as the fete nationale, and thousands of persons called
at the legation on those days; deputations were sent by the town
and official authorities to show how deep was the Belgian feeling
for the United States.  America was for the Belgians "une second
Patrie," because they felt that, although America was at the time
remaining neutral, her sympathy was entirely on our side, and when
the time would come she would even prove it on the battlefields.

It may therefore be said that although the war has had for my country
the most cruel consequences, there is one consolation to it.  It
has shown that humility is better than the pessimist had said it
was, and that money is not the only god before which the nations
bow.  It has revealed that all over the world, and especially in
America, there is a respect for right and for duty; it has proved
that the moral beauty of an action is fully appreciated.  The war
has revealed Belgium to America, and America to Belgium.  The tie
between our two countries is stronger than any tie has ever been
between two far distant people, and nothing will be able to break
it, as it rests not on some political interest or some selfish
reason, but because it has been interwoven with the very fibers of
the hearts of the people.

Good Old Bernstorff!




Then entrance of America in the war has been nothing short of a
miracle--perhaps, with the Marne, the most wonderful miracle, among
many others, which we have witnessed since August, 1914.

I do not wish to be misunderstood.  I am not necessarily referring
to supernatural influences.  This will remain a matter of opinion--or
rather of belief.  I am merely speaking from the ordinary point
of view of the main in the street concerning what is likely or not
likely to happen in the world.

People have very generously admired Belgium's attitude, but anybody
knowing the Belgians and their King might have prophesied Liege,
and the Yser battle.  Others have praised the timely interference
of England and the self-sacrifice of the many thousand British
volunteers who rushed to arms, during the early days of the war,
to avenge the wrong done to a small people whose only crime was
to stand in the way of a blind and ruthless military machine.  But
such an attitude was too much in the tradition of British fair
play to come as a surprise to those who knew intimately the country
and the people.  Besides, from the Government's point of view,
non-intervention would have been a political mistake for which the
whole nation would have had to pay dearly in the near future, as
subsequent events have conclusively shown.

But America?  What had America to do in the conflict?  She had not
signed the treaties guaranteeing Belgium's neutrality.  She was
not directly threatened by German Imperialism.  She had never taken
any part in European politics.  Her moral responsibility was not
engaged and her immediate interest was to preserve to the end all
the advantages of neutrality and to benefit, after the war, by the
exhaustion of Europe...

I had the opportunity of seeing, a few days ago, the second contingent
of American troops marching through London on their way to France.
The Belgian flag flew from our window and, as we cheered the men,
some of them, recognizing the colors, waved their hand towards
us.  And as I watched their bright smile and remembered the eager
interest shown by so many citizens of the States to Belgian's fate,
and the deep indignation provoked beyond the Atlantic by the German
atrocities and by the more recent deportations, I was inclined
to think, for one moment, that I had solved the problem, and that
their sympathy for Belgium had brought these soldiers to the rescue.
We are so easily inclined to exaggerate the part which one country
is playing!

But as I looked at the men again, I was struck by the grim expression
on their faces, the almost threatening determination of their light
swinging step.  And I soon realized that neither their sympathy
for England, France or Belgium had brought them here.  They had not
come merely to fight for other peoples, they had their own personal
grievance.  they were not there only to help their friends, but
also to punish their enemies.

As I turned in to resume my work, I heard a friend of mine who
whispered, rubbing his hands:  "Good old Bernstorff!  Kind old von
Paepen!  Blessed old Ludendorf!"

And I understood that Germany had been our best champion, and that
her plots, her intrigues, and her U boats had done more to convert
America than our most eloquent denunciations.  There is no neutrality
possible in the face of lawlessness and Germanism.  Sooner or later
we feel that "he how is not with Him is against Him."  And there
is no compromise, no conciliation which might prevail against such
feeling.

The War in Europe




Translation of a part of an address by Mr. Tsa Yuan-Pei, Chancellor
of the Government University of Peking and formerly Minister of
Education in the first Republican Cabinet, delivered on March 3rd,
1917, at Peking before the "Wai Chiao Hou Yuan Hui," or a "Society
for the Support of Diplomacy."


I am a scholar and not a practical politician.  Therefore I can
only give you my views as a man of letters.  As I see it, the War
in Europe is really one between Right and Might, or in other words,
between Morality and Savagery.  Our proverbs run to this effect:
"Every one should sweep the snow in front of his door and leave
alone the frost on the roof of his neighbor," and that "when the
neighbors are fighting, close your door."  These proverbs have been
used by the anti-war party in China as arguments against China's
entrance into the War.  The War in Europe, however, is not the "frost
on the roof of our neighbor," but rather the "snow right in front
of our door."  It is not a "fight between neighbors," but rather a
quarrel within the family--the family of Nations.  China therefore
cannot remain indifferent.  For, if Germany should eventually win
the War, it would mean the triumph of Might over Right, and the
world would be without moral principles.  Should this occur, it
would endanger the future of China.  It is therefore necessary for
China to cast her lot with the Right.

Invocation




Because of the decision of a few,--  Because in half a score
of haughty minds   The night lay black and terrible, thy winds, O
Europe! are a stench on heaven's blue.  Thy scars abide, and here
is nothing new:   Still from the throne goes forth the dark that
blinds,   And still the satiated morning finds The unending thunder
and the bloody dew.

Shall night be lord forever, and not light?    Look forth, tormented
nations!  Let your eyes     Behold this horror that the few have
done!  Then turn, strike hands, and in your burning might   Impel
the fog of murder from the skies,     And sow the hearts of Europe
with the sun!

The Test




It has been my fortune to see something of the war with the army
in France, and something also of what war means for those at home
who, having sent out sons and brothers, are themselves compelled
to wait and watch.  I have seen suffering beyond imagination, pain,
hardship and misery.  I have seen anxiety and sorrow which I should
have guessed beforehand men could not have borne without going mad.
But I have also seen the human spirit rise to wonderful heights.
Men and women have shown themselves greater, nobler, stronger than
in the old days of peace I thought they could be.

It would not be very astonishing if the strain of war had called
forth a fresh greatness in those whose lives were already seen to
be in some way great; in our leaders, our teachers, our thinkers.
Or if an added nobility had appeared in our aristocracies of birth,
intellect, education, wealth, or whatever other accidents set men
above the mass of their fellows.  Of such we expect a great response
to a great demand.  And we have not been disappointed.  The old
rule of life, NOBLESSE OBLIGE, has proved that it still possesses
driving force with the most of those to whom it applies.  The thing
which has amazed me is the greatness of the common man.

This I in no way expected or looked for.  I confess that, before
the war, I was no believer in the great qualities of those who are
called "the people."  They seemed to me to be living lives either
selfish, sometimes brutal, always sordid; or else mean, narrow, and
circumscribed by senseless conventions.  I believed that society,
if it progressed at all, would be forced forward by the few, that
the many had not in them the qualities necessary for advance, were
incapable of the far visions which make advance desirable.  I know
now that I was wrong, and I have come to the faith that the hoe of
the future is in the common people who have shown themselves great.

So, I suppose, I may contribute to a book with such a title as
"The Defenders of Democracy."  For now I am sure that democracy
has promise and hope in it.  Only I am not sure that democracy has
even begun to understand itself.  The common people have displayed
virtues so great that those who have seen them unite in a chorus
of praise.  Their leaders, elected persons, guides chosen by votes
and popular acclamation, have shown in a hundred ways that they
will not, dare not, trust the people.  Our silly censorships, our
concealments of unpleasant truths, our suppression of criticism,
our galling infringements of personal liberty, witness to the fact
that authority distrusts the source from which it sprang; that the
leaders of our democracy reckon the common people unfit to know, to
think or to act.  If we are defending democracy we are sacrificing
liberty.  Will you, in America, do better in this respect than we
have done?  you believed in the common people before England did.
You believe in them, if we may trust your words, more completely
than England does.  Do you believe in them sufficiently to trust
them?  Or do you think that democracy can be defended only after
it has been blindfolded, hand-cuffed and gagged?  This is what you
have got to show the world.  No one doubts that you can fight.  No
one doubts that you will fight, with all your strength, as England
is fighting.  What we wonder is whether your great principle of
government, by the people and for the people, will stand the test
of a war like this.

The New Comradeship




Democracy is the outward and visible sign that a nation recognizes
its own needs and aspirations.  Democracy wells up from the very
pit of things.  Its value is its foundation in actuality, its
concordance with the slow unending process of man's evolution from
the animal he was.  Democracy, for one with any comic and cosmic
animal sense, is the only natural form of government, because
alone it recognizes States as organisms, with spontaneous growth,
and a free will of their own.  Democracy is final; other forms of
government are but steps on the way to it.  It is the big thing,
because it can and does embody and make use of Aristocracy.  It
is the rule of the future, because all human progress gradually
tends to recognition of God in man, and not outside of him; to the
establishment of the humanistic creed, and the belief that we have
the future in our own hands.

In life at large, whom does one respect--the man who gropes and
stumbles upward to control of his instincts, and full development
of his powers, confronting each new darkness and obstacle as it
arises; or the man who shelters in a cloister, and lives by rote
and rules hung up for him by another in his cell?  The first man
lives, the second does but exist.  So it is with nations.

The American and the Englishman are fundamentally democratic because
they are fundamentally self-reliant.  Each demands to know why he
should do a thing before he does it.  This is, I think, the great
link between two peoples in many ways very different; and they who
ardently desire abiding friendship between our two countries will
do well never to lose sight of it.  Any sapping of this quality
of self-reliance, or judging for oneself, in either country, any
undermining of the basis of democracy will imperil our new-found
comradeship.  You in America have before all things to fear the
warping power of great Trusts; we in England to dread the paralyzing
influence of Press groups.  We have both to beware of the force
which the pressure of a great war inevitably puts into the hands of
Military Directorates.  We are for the time being hardly democracies,
even on the surface; the democratic machinery still exists, but is
so ungeared by Censorship and Universal Service, that probably it
could not work even if it wanted to.  We are now in the nature of
business concerns, run by Directors safe in office till General
Meetings, which cannot be held till after the War.  But I am not
greatly alarmed.  When the War is over, the pendulum will swing
back; the individual conscience which is our guarantee for democracy
and friendship will come into its own again, and shape our destinies
in common towards freedom and humanity.  The English-speaking
democracies, in firm union, can and ought to be the unshifting
ballast of a better world.

Questionings




I have a brilliant idea which, without any parade of modesty, I
hereby commend to the notice of the American, French and British
Governments.  Let them get together as soon as may be and give us an
authoritative definition of Democracy.  Then we shall know where,
collectively, we are.  Of course you may say that it has been
defined for all time by Abraham Lincoln.  But thrilling in its
clear simplicity as his slogan epigram may be, a complex political
and social system cannot be fully dealt with in fifteen words.  I
thought I knew what it was until a tidy few millions of friends
and myself were knocked silly by recent events in Russia.  Here,
where the privates of a regiment hold a mass meeting and discuss for
hours an order to advance to the relief of sorely pressed comrades
and decide not to obey it, and eventually throw down their rifles
and with a meus conscia recti, proudly run away, we have Democracy
with a vengeance.  Not one of the Defenders of Democracy who are
writing in this book would stand for it a second.  Nor would they
stand for the slobbering maniacs who yearn to throw themselves into
the arms of the Germans, and, with the kiss of peace and universal
brotherhood, kiss away their brother's blood from their blood-smeared
faces.  Nor would they stand entirely for those staunch democrats
who, inspired with a burning sense of human wrongs but with none
of proportion or humor, would sacrifice vital interests of humanity
in general for the transient amelioration of the lot of a particular
section of the community.  For years these visionaries told us that
every penny spent on army or navy was a robbery of the working-man.
We yielded to him many pennies; but alas, they now have to be repaid
in blood.

America has joined the civilized world in the struggle against the
surviving systems of medieval barbarism in Europe that have been
permitted to exist under the veneer of civilization.  She sees clearly
what she has to destroy.  So do we.  No American and Englishman
can meet but that they grip hands and thank God together that they
are comrades in this Holy War.  They are out, like Knights of Fable,
to rid the earth of a pestilential monster; and they will not rest
until their foot is on his slain monster's head.

Which is, by Heaven! a glorious and soul-uplifting enterprise.  In
it the blood of the Martyrs, rising to God.  But with this difference:
the Martyrs died for a constructive scheme--that of Christianity.
What is the constructive scheme for which we are dying?  It is easy
to say the Democratization of Mankind.  It is a matter of common
assent that this consummation is ardently desired by the Royal Family
of England, by enlightened Indian Princes, by the philanthropists
of America, by the French artist, by the Roumanian peasant, by the
howling syndicalist in South Wales, by the Belgian socialist, by
the eager soul in the frail body who is at the helm of storm-tossed
Russia to-day, by the Montenegrin mountaineer, by the Sydney Larrikin
yelling down conscription, by millions of units belonging to the
civilized nations of such social and racial divergence that the
mind is staggered by the conception of them all fighting under one
banner.  But are we sure they are all fighting for the same thing?
If they're not, there will be the deuce to pay all over the
terrestrial globe, even with a crushed Central European militarism.

Therefore, with the same absence of modesty I cry for an authoritative
crystallization of the democratic aims of the civilized world.
England and France have groped their way through centuries towards
a vague ideal.  America proudly began her existence by a proclamation
of the equal rights of man.  She proudly proclaims them now; but the
world is involved in such a complicated muddle, that the utterances
of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln (to say nothing of their
intellectual and political ancestor Jean Jacques Rousseau) require
amplification.  The political thought of the older nations of
Europe is tired out.  It is for the fresher genius of America to
lead them towards the solution of the greatest problem which has
ever faced mankind:--the final, constructive and all-satisfying
definition of the myriadwise interpreted word Democracy.

Democracy in Peace and War




Democracy is by nature a lover of peace.  That is the state which
it regards as the normal condition of human life, and in which
it seeks its best rewards and triumphs by the organization of the
common effort of all citizens for the common welfare.

But while democracy is pacific in its desires and aims, it is not
a "pacifist."  It is willing and able, though not always at the
moment ready, to take up arms in self-defense.  In its broadening
vision of a fraternity of mankind, which shall be in the good future
not only intranational but also international, it is willing also
to FIGHT for the safety of its principles everywhere, and for the
security of all the peoples in a true and orderly liberty.  That
is the position of the democracy of the United States of America
to-day.

As in peace, so in war, the success of the democratic effort
depends upon the fullness of the cooperation between all classes
and conditions of men and women.  Those men who are fit for military
service on land or sea must render it willingly and to the utmost
of their strength.  Those who by reason of age or weakness cannot
undertake that service without danger of becoming a burden to the
fighting forces, must work to sustain the army and the fleet of
freedom.  "If any man will not work neither let him eat."

The women also must do their part, since they are citizens just as
much as the men.  They must undertake those tasks of industry of
which they are capable and thus relieve the need of labor in all
fields.  Above all they must give themselves to those tasks of mercy
for which they have a natural aptitude.  And through all they must
give sympathy, inspiration, and courage to the men who fight for
Liberty and Democracy.

Sunrise over the Peristyle




"Ye shall know the truth, and
 the truth shall make you free."


Look! we shall know the truth--it is thy word;
The truth, O Lord--shining, invincible,
Unawed.  And shall we love it, Lord, like this,
This half-dark flushing with the wondrous hope?
How can we love it more?

                          Sweet is the hush
Brimming the dim void world, soothing the beat
Of the great-hearted lake that lies unlit
Beyond that silver portal.  Peace is here
In moony palaces that rose for her
Pale, lustrous--it is well with her to dwell.
The truth--will not these phantom fabrics fail
Under the fierce white fire--yes, float away
Like mists that wanly rise and choke the wind?

So merciless is truth--how shall we live
And bear the glare?  Now rosily smiles the earth,
And bold young couriers climb the slope of heaven,
With gaudy flags aflare.  The towered clouds,
Lofty, impregnable, are captured now--
Their turrets flame with banners.  Who abides
Under the smooth wide rim of the worn world
That the high heavens should hail him like a king--
Even like a lover?  If it be the Truth,
Ah, shall our souls wake with the triumph, Lord?
Shall we be free according to thy word,
Brave to yield all?

                     Look! will it come like this--
A vivid glory burning at the gate
Over the sudden verge of golden waves?
The tall white columns stand like seraphim
With high arms locked for song.  The city lies
Pearled like the courts of heaven, waiting the tread
Of souls made wise with joy.  Why should we fear?
The Truth--ah, let it come to test the dream;
Give us the Truth, O Lord, that in its light
The world may know thy will, and dare be free.

Reminiscences of Booth




Few of the younger people of the present generation know, by personal
experience, how nobly and incomparably Edwin Booth enriched the
modern stage with his vivid portraitures of Shakespearean characters.
The tragic fervor, the startling passion, and the impressive dignity
with which he invested his various roles, have not been equaled, I
daresay, by any actor on the English speaking stage since the days
of Garrick and Kean.  He had a voice that vibrated with every mood,
and a mien, despite his short stature, that gave a lofty dignity
to every part that he played.  But Booth as himself was a simple,
modest, amiable human being.  Many of us younger men came to know
him in a personal way, when he established in New York City the
Players' Club, which he dedicated to the dramatic profession, and
which is now a splendid and permanent monument to his fame and
generosity.

I saw him frequently and had many chats with him.  When I undertook
the management of E. H. Southern, he was very much interested
because he knew young Sothern's father, the original Lord Dundrery;
so, when Mr. Sothern appeared in the first play under my management,
"The Highest Bidder," I invited Mr. Booth to witness the performance.
He expressed his delight at seeing his old friend's son doing such
delightful work, and the three of us afterwards met at a little
supper at the Players'.  He told us that he came nearly being the
Godfather of young Sothern, and that he was to have been called
"Edwin" after himself; but the reason why his name was changed to
"Edward," he explained, was as follows:  When young Sothern was
born in New Orleans, the elder Sothern telegraphed Booth, asking
him to stand as Godfather to his boy, but Booth did not wish to
take the responsibility, doubtless for reasons of his own, and so
his name was changed to "Edward"; but he confessed that it was a
matter he greatly regretted.  He told us many stories of his early
career as an actor, one of which I remember as a very amusing experience
on the part of the elder actor when on his way to Australia.  Mr.
Booth had an engagement to play in that distant section, and with
five members, the nucleus of a company, started from San Francisco.
They had occasion to stop at Honolulu en route.  The stop there
being longer than originally anticipated, and the news of his
arrival having spread, King Kamehameha sent a request that he give
a performance of "Richard III" in the local theater.  In spite of
managerial difficulties, Booth (being then a young man, ardent and
ambitious) sought to give a semblance with the scanty material at
hand, of a fair performance.  He had to secure the cooperation of
members of the local amateur company.  The best he was enabled to
do for the part of Queen Elizabeth was an actor, short in stature,
defective in speech and accent, but earnest in temperament, whom
he cast for this eminent role.  The other parts were filled as
best he could, and the principals with him enabled Mr. Booth to
give some semblance of a decent performance.  In order to properly
advertise the event, he secured the assistance of several Hawaiians,
and furnished them with a paste made out of their native product
called "poi."  He discovered later, to his amazement, that not
a bill had been posted, and that the "poi," being a valuable food
article, had been appropriated by the two individuals, who decamped.
Mr. Booth, with his colleagues, then personally posted the town
with the bills of the impending performance.  On the evening the
house was crowded.  The King occupied a seat in the wings, there
being no place for him in the hall.  When the throne scene was to
be set for the play, word was sent to His Majesty humbly asking
the loan of the throne chair, which he then occupied, for use in
the scene--a favor which His Royal Highness readily granted.  At
the end of the performance, word was brought to Booth that the King
wished to see him.  Booth, shy and modest as he was, and feeling
that he could not speak the language, or that His Royal Highness
could not speak his, approached His Majesty timidly.  The latter
stepped forward, slapped the actor heartily on the back and said:
"Booth, this is as fine a performance as I saw your father give
twenty years ago."

The question as to whether an actor should feel his part or control
his emotions, has been an argument which has interested the dramatic
profession for many years, since it was first promulgated by the
French writer Diderot, and afterwards ably discussed by Henry Irving
and Coquelin.  Of course, we all feel that no matter how violent
the actor's stress of emotion is, he must control his resources
with absolute restraint and poise.  Sometimes, however, an actor
feels he is under the sway of his part in an unusual degree and
comes to the conviction, through his excitement, that he has given
a greater performance than usual.  So Booth, one night at his own
theater, seeing his beloved daughter in a box, and desiring to
impress her with his work, played with, as he felt, a degree of
emotion that made him realize that he had given an unusually powerful
interpretation.  At the end of the play, his daughter ran back to
him and said:  "Why, dad, what is the matter with you?"  And Booth,
awaiting her approval, said:  "Matter?"  "Why you gave the worst
performance I ever witnessed," she said.  This control of one's
resources and the check upon one's feelings was indicated at another
time during a performance of Booth, of "Richelieu," as told to me
by the actor's friend, the late Laurence Hutton, the writer.  Mr.
Hutton and Mr. Booth were sitting in the latter's dressing room at
Booth's Theater.  Booth was, as usual, smoking his beloved pipe.
When he heard his cue, he arose, and walked with Hutton to the
prompter's entrance, where, giving his pipe to his friend, said:
"Larry, will you keep the pipe going until I come off?"  Booth
entered on the scene; then came the big moment in the play when the
nobles and the weak King had assembled to defy the power of the
Cardinal; and Richelieu launches (as Booth always did with thrilling
effect) the terrifying curse of Rome--a superb bit of oratorical
eloquence.  At the conclusion, the house shouted its wild and
demonstrative approval, and when the curtain dropped on this uproar
for the last time, Booth approached Hutton at the prompter's entrance
saying, in his usual quiet voice:  "Is the pipe still going, Larry?"

No actor we have ever known has inspired so much genuine affection--I
may say almost idolatry--as the simple Edwin Booth aroused in the
hearts of his friends and his fellow-workers.  In the beautiful
Players' Club House, which he bequeathed to the dramatic profession,
he presented also his own valuable theatrical library, numbering
several thousand memorable works on the stage; and no one event
greater than this gift to his fellow-players has ever occurred in
the dramatic profession.

God of My Faith




A Play for Pacifists in One Act


"If the God of my faith be a liar
 Who is it that I shall trust?"


The People in the Play

Nelson Dartrey

Dermod Gilruth


The action passes in Dartrey's Chambers in the late Spring of
Nineteen Hundred and Fifteen.

(The lowering of the Curtain momentarily will denote the passing
of several days.)





God of My Faith




The curtain discloses a dark oak room

NELSON DARTREY is seated at a writing table studying maps.  He is
a man in the early thirties, prematurely worn and old.  His face
is burned a deep brick color and is sharpened by fatigue and loss
of blood.  His hair is sparse, dry and turning gray.  Around the
upper part of his head is a bandage covered largely by a black
skull-cap.  Of over average height the man is spare and muscular.
The eye is keen and penetrating:  his voice abrupt and authoritative.
An occasional flash of humor brings an old-time twinkle to the one
and heartiness to the other.  He is wearing the undress uniform of
a major in the British army.

The door bell rings.

With an impatient ejaculation he goes into the passage and opens
the outer door.  Standing outside cheerfully humming a tune is a
large, forceful, breezy young man of twenty-eight.  He is DERMOD
GILRUTH.  Splendid in physique, charming of manner, his slightly-marked
Dublin accent lends a piquancy to his conversation.  He has all
the ease and poise of a traveled, polished young man of breeding.
Dartrey's face brightens as he holds out a welcoming hand.

DARTREY

Hello, Gil.

GILRUTH

(Saluting him as he laughs genially) May I come into officers'
quarters?

DARTREY

I'm glad to have you.  I'm quite alone with yours on my hands.  (He
brings Gilruth into the room and wheels a comfortable leather arm
chair in front of him) Sit down.

GILRUTH

Indeed I will not.  Look at your desk there.  I'll not interrupt
your geography for more than a minute.

DARTREY

(Forces him into the chair)  I'm glad to get away from it.  Why,
you look positively boyish.

GILRUTH

And why not?  I am a boy. (Chuckles)

DARTREY

What are you so pleased with yourself about?

GILRUTH

The greatest thing in the world for youth and high-spirits.  I'm
going to be married next week.

DARTREY

(Incredulously)  You're not?

GILRUTH

I tell you I am.

DARTREY

Don't be silly.

GILRUTH

What's silly about it?

DARTREY

Oh, I don't know.

GILRUTH

Of course you don't know.  You've never tried it.

DARTREY

I should think not.

GILRUTH

Well, I'm going to and I want you to father me.  Stand up beside
me and see me through.  Will you?

DARTREY

If you want me to.

GILRUTH

Well, I do want you to.

DARTREY

All right.

GILRUTH

You don't mind now?

DARTREY

My dear chap.  It's charming of you to think of me.

GILRUTH

I've known you longer than any one over here.  And I like you
better.  So there you are.

DARTREY

(Laughing)  Poor old Dermod!  Well, well!

GILRUTH

There's nothing to laugh at, or "well, well" about.

DARTREY

Do I know the---?

GILRUTH

(Shakes his head)  She's never been over before.  Everything will
be new to her.  I tell you it's going to be wonderful.  I've planned
out the most delightful trip through Ireland--she's Irish, too.

DARTREY

Is she?

GILRUTH

But, like me, born in America.  She's crazy to see the old country.

DARTREY

She couldn't have a better guide.

GILRUTH

(Enthusiastically)  She's beautiful, she's brilliant:  she's
good--she's everything a man could wish.

DARTREY

That's the spirit.  Will you make your home over here?

GILRUTH

No.  We'll stay till the autumn.  Then I must go back to America.
But some day when all this fighting is over and people talk
of something besides killing each other I want to have a home in
Ireland.

DARTREY

I suppose most of you Irishmen in America want to do that?

GILRUTH

Indeed they do not.  Once they get out to America and do well they
stay there and become citizens.  My father did.  Do you think he'd
live in Ireland now?  Not he.  He talks all the time about Ireland
and the hated Sassenachs--that's what he calls you English--and
he urges the fellows at home in the old country to fight for their
rights.  But since he made his fortune and became an American
citizen the devil a foot has he ever put on Irish soil.  He's always
going, but he hasn't go there yet.  And as for living there?  Oh,
no, America is good enough for him, because his interests are
there.  I want to live in Ireland because my heart is there.  So
was my poor mother's.

(Springing up) Now I'm off.  You don't know how happy you make me
by promising to be my best man.

DARTREY

My dear fellow--

GILRUTH

And just wait until you see her.  Eyes you lose yourself in.  A
voice soft as velvet.  A brain so nimble that wit flows like music
from her tongue.  Poetry too.  She dances like thistledown and
sings like a thrush.  And with all that she's in love with me.

DARTREY

I'm delighted.

GILRUTH

I want her to meet you first.  A snug little dinner before the
wedding.  She's heard so much against the English I want her to
see the best specimen they've got.

(Dartrey laughs heartily)  I tell you if you pass muster with her
you have the passport to Kingdom come.  (Laughing as well as he
grips Dartrey's hand)  Good-by.

DARTREY

(As they walk to the door)  When will it be?

GILRUTH

Next Tuesday.  I'll ring you up and give you the full particulars.

DARTREY

In church?

GILRUTH

Church!  Cathedral!  His Eminence will officiate.

DARTREY

Topping.

GILRUTH

Well, you see, we Irish only marry once.  So we make an occasion
of it.

DARTREY

Splendid.  I'll look forward to it.

GILRUTH

(Looking at the bandage)  Is your head getting all right?

DARTREY

Oh, dear, yes.  It's quite healed up.  I'll have this thing off
in a day or two.  (Touching the bandage)  I expect to be back in
a few weeks.

GILRUTH

(Anxiously)  Again?

DARTREY

Yes.

GILRUTH

If ever a man had done his share, you have.

DARTREY

They need me.  They need us all.

GILRUTH

The third time.

DARTREY

There are many who have done the same.

GILRUTH

(Shudders)  How long will it last?

DARTREY

Until the Hun is beaten.

GILRUTH

Years, eh?

DARTREY

It looks like it.  We've hardly begun yet.  It will take a year to
really get the ball rolling.  Then things will happen.  Tell me.
How do they feel in America?  Frankly.

GILRUTH

All the people who matter are pro-Ally.

DARTREY

Are you sure?

GILRUTH

I'm positive.

DARTREY

Are you?  Come, now.

GILRUTH

Why, of course I am.

DARTREY

They may be pro-Ally, but they're not pro-English.

GILRUTH

That's true.  Many of them are not.  But if ever the test comes,
they will be.

DARTREY

(Shakes his head doubtfully)  I wonder.  It seems a pity not to
bury all the Bunker-Hill and Boston-tea-chest prejudices.

GILRUTH

You're right there.

DARTREY

Why your boys and girls are taught in their school-books to hate
us.

GILRUTH

In places they are.  Now that I know the English a little I have
been agitating to revisit them.  It all seems so damned cheap and
petty for a big country to belittle a great nation through the
mouth of children.

DARTREY

There's no hatred like family hatred.  After all we're cousins,
speaking the same tongue and with pretty much the same outlook.

GILRUTH

There's one race in America that holds back as strongly as it can
any better understanding between the two countries, and that's
my race--the Irish.  And well I know it.  I was brought up on it.
There are men to-day, men of position too, in our big cities who
have openly said they want to see England crushed in this war.

DARTREY

So I've heard.  It would be a sorry day for the rest of civilization,
and particularly America, if we were.

GILRUTH

You can't convince them of that.  They carry on the prejudices
and hatred of generations.  I have accused some of them of being
actively pro-German; of tinkering with German money to foster
revolution in Ireland.

DARTREY

Do you believe that?

GILRUTH

I do.  Thank God there are not many of them.  I have accused them
of taking German money and then urging the poor unfortunate poets and
dreamers to do the revolting while they are safely three thousand
miles away.  I don't know of many who are willing to cross the water
and do it themselves.  Talking and writing seditious articles is
safe.  Take my own father.  He says frankly that he doesn't want
Germany to win because he hates Germans.  Most Irishmen do.  Besides
they've done my father some very dirty tricks.  But all the same
he wants to see England lose.  All the doubtful ones I know, who
don't dare come out in the open, speak highly of the French and are
silent when English is mentioned.  I blame a great deal of that on
your Government.  You take no pains to let the rest of the world
know what England is doing.  You and I know that without the
British fleet America wouldn't rest as easy as she does to-day, and
without the little British army the Huns would have been in Paris
and Calais months ago.  We know that, and so do many others.  But
the great mass of people, particularly the Irish, cry all the time,
"What is England doing?"  Your government should see to it that
they know what she's doing.

DARTREY

It's not headquarters' way.

GILRUTH

I know it isn't.  And the more's the pity.  Another thing where
you went all wrong.  Why not have let Asquith clear up the Irish
muddle?  Why truckle to a handful of disloyal North of Ireland
traitors?  If the Government had court martialed the ring-leaders,
tried the rest for treason and put the Irish Government in Dublin,
why, man, three-quarters of the male population of the South of
Ireland would be in the trenches now.

DARTREY

Don't let us get into that.  I was one of the officers who mutinied.
I would rather resign my commission than shoot down loyal subjects.

GILRUTH

(Hotly)  Loyal?  Loyal!  When they refused to carry out their
Government's orders?  When they deny justice to a long suffering
people?  Loyal!  Don't prostitute the word.

DARTREY

(Angrily)  I don't want to---

GILRUTH

(Going on vehemently)  It's just that kind of pig-headed ignorance
that has kept the two countries from understanding each other.  Why
shouldn't Ireland govern herself.  South Africa does.  Australia
does.  And when you're in trouble they leap to your flag.  Yet
there is a country a few miles from you that sends the best of her
people to your professions and they invariably get to the top of
them.  Irishmen have commanded your armies and Ireland has given
you admirals for your fleet and at least one of us has been your
Lord Chief Justice.  Yet, by God, they can't be trusted to govern
themselves.  I tell you the English treatment of Ireland makes her
a laughing-stock of the world.

DARTREY

(Opens the door, then turns and looks straight at Gilruth)  My head
bothers me.  Will you kindly---

GILRUTH

(All contrition)  I'm so sorry.  I didn't mean to blaze out.  Do
forgive me like a good fellow.  It's an old sore of mine and
sometimes it makes me wince.  It did just now.  Don't be mad with
me.

(The sound of a boy's voice calling newspapers is heard faintly in
the distance; then the hoarse tones of a man shouting indistinctly;
then a chorus of men and boys comes nearer and nearer calling
of some calamity.  Dartrey hurries out through the outer door.
Gilruth stands ashamed.  He does not want to leave his friend in
bad blood.  He would like to put things right before going.  He
waits for Dartrey to come back.

In a few minutes Dartrey walks through the outer doorway and into
the room.  He is very white, very agitated and his face is set and
determined.  He is reading a special edition of an evening paper
with great "scare" head lines.

The sound of the voices crying the news in the street grows fainter
and fainter.

Dartrey stops in front of Gilruth and tries to speak; nothing
coherent comes from his lips.  He thrusts the paper into Gilruth's
hands and watches his face as he reads.

Gilruth reads it once slowly, then rapidly.  He stands immovable
staring at the news-sheet.  It slips from his fingers and he cowers
down, stooping at the shoulders, glaring at the floor.)

DARTRY

(Almost frenzied)  Now will your country come in?  Now will they
fight for civilization?  A hundred of her men, wo
