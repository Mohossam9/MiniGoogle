sciousness of his vast strength,
Deerslayer had about him the calm determination that promises
greater perseverance, and a resolution more likely to effect its
object.  It was the stern, resolute eye of the latter, rather than
the noisy vehemence of the first, that excited her apprehensions.
Hurry soon reached the spot where the canoe was fastened, but
not before Deerslayer had spoken in a quick, earnest voice to the
Serpent, in Delaware.  The latter had been the first, in truth, to
hear the sounds of the oars, and he had gone upon the platform in
jealous watchfulness.  The light Satisfied him that a message was
coming, and when the boy cast his bundle of sticks at his feet, it
neither moved his anger nor induced surprise.  He merely stood at
watch, rifle in hand, to make certain that no treachery lay behind
the defiance.  As Deerslayer now called to him, he stepped into the
canoe, and quick as thought removed the paddles.  Hurry was furious
when he found that he was deprived of the means of proceeding.  He
first approached the Indian with loud menaces, and even Deerslayer
stood aghast at the probable consequences.  March shook his
sledge-hammer fists and flourished his arms as he drew near the
Indian, and all expected he would attempt to fell the Delaware
to the earth ; one of them, at least, was well aware that such
an experiment would be followed by immediate bloodshed.  But even
Hurry was awed by the stern composure of the chief, and he, too,
knew that such a man was not to be outraged with impunity; he
therefore turned to vent his rage on Deerslayer, where he foresaw
no consequences so terrible.  What might have been the result of
this second demonstration if completed, is unknown, since it was
never made.

"Hurry," said a gentle, soothing voice at his elbow, "it's wicked
to be so angry, and God will not overlook it.  The Iroquois treated
you well, and they didn't take your scalp, though you and father
wanted to take theirs."

The influence of mildness on passion is well known.  Hetty, too,
had earned a sort of consideration, that had never before been
enjoyed by her, through the self-devotion and decision of her recent
conduct.  Perhaps her established mental imbecility, by removing
all distrust of a wish to control, aided her influence.  Let the
cause be as questionable as it might, the effect we sufficiently
certain.  Instead of throttling his old fellow-traveler, Hurry
turned to the girl and poured out a portion of his discontent, if
none of his anger, in her attentive ears.

"Tis too bad, Hetty!"  he exclaimed; "as bad as a county gaol or
a lack of beaver, to get a creatur' into your very trap, then to
see it get off.  As much as six first quality skins, in valie, has
paddled off on them clumsy logs, when twenty strokes of a well-turned
paddle would overtake 'em.  I say in valie, for as to the boy in
the way of natur', he is only a boy, and is worth neither more nor
less than one.  Deerslayer, you've been ontrue to your fri'nds in
letting such a chance slip through my fingers well as your own."

The answer was given quietly, but with a voice as steady as a
fearless nature and the consciousness of rectitude could make it.
"I should have been untrue to the right, had I done otherwise,"
returned the Deerslayer, steadily; "and neither you, nor any other
man has authority to demand that much of me.  The lad came on
a lawful business, and the meanest red-skin that roams the woods
would be ashamed of not respecting his ar'n'd.  But he's now far
beyond your reach, Master March, and there's little use in talking,
like a couple of women, of what can no longer be helped."

So saying, Deerslayer turned away, like one resolved to waste no more
Words on the subject, while Hutter pulled Harry by the sleeve, and
led him into the ark.  There they sat long in private conference.
In the mean time, the Indian and his friend had their secret
consultation; for, though it wanted Some three or four hours to the
rising of the star, the former could not Abstain from canvassing
his scheme, and from opening his heart to the other.  Judith,
too, yielded to her softer feelings, and listened to the whole of
Hetty's artless narrative of what occurred after she landed.  The
woods had few terrors for either of these girls, educated as they
had been, and accustomed as they were to look out daily at their
rich expanse or to wander beneath their dark shades; but the elder
sister felt that she would have hesitated about thus venturing
alone into an Iroquois camp.  Concerning Hist, Hetty was not very
communicative.  She spoke of her kindness and gentleness and of the
meeting in the forest; but the secret of Chingachgook was guarded
with a shrewdness and fidelity that many a sharper-witted girl
might have failed to display.

At length the several conferences were broken up by the reappearance
of Hutter on the platform.  Here he assembled the whole party, and
communicated as much of his intentions as he deemed expedient.  Of
the arrangement made by Deerslayer, to abandon the castle during
the night and to take refuge in the ark, he entirely approved.
It struck him as it had the others, as the only effectual means
of escaping destruction.  Now that the savages had turned their
attention to the construction of rafts, no doubt could exist of
their at least making an attempt to carry the building, and the
message of the bloody sticks sufficiently showed their confidence
in their own success.  In short, the old man viewed the night as
critical, and he called on all to get ready as soon as possible, in
order to abandon the dwellings temporarily at least, if not forever.

These communications made, everything proceeded promptly and with
intelligence; the castle was secured in the manner already described,
the canoes were withdrawn from the dock and fastened to the ark by
the side of the other; the few necessaries that had been left in
the house were transferred to the cabin, the fire was extinguished
and all embarked.

The vicinity of the hills, with their drapery of pines, had the
effect to render nights that were obscure darker than common on the
lake.  As usual, however, a belt of comparative light was etched
through the centre of the sheet, while it was within the shadows
of the mountains that the gloom rested most heavily on the water.
The island, or castle, stood in this belt of comparative light, but
still the night was so dark as to cover the aperture of the ark.
At the distance of an observer on the shore her movements could not
be seen at all, more particularly as a background of dark hillside
filled up the perspective of every view that was taken diagonally
or directly across the water.  The prevailing wind on the lakes
of that region is west, but owing to the avenues formed by the
mountains it is frequently impossible to tell the true direction of
the currents, as they often vary within short distances and brief
differences of time.  This is truer in light fluctuating puffs of
air than in steady breezes; though the squalls of even the latter
are familiarly known to be uncertain and baffling in all mountainous
regions and narrow waters.  On the present occasion, Hutter himself
(as he shoved the ark from her berth at the side of the platform)
was at a loss to pronounce which way the wind blew.  In common,
this difficulty was solved by the clouds, which, floating high
above the hill tops, as a matter of course obeyed the currents; but
now the whole vault of heaven seemed a mass of gloomy wall.  Not
an opening of any sort was visible, and Chingachgook we already
trembling lest the non-appearance of the star might prevent his
betrothed from being punctual to her appointment.  Under these
circumstances, Hutter hoisted his sail, seemingly with the sole
intention of getting away from the castle, as it might be dangerous
to remain much longer in its vicinity.  The air soon filled the
cloth, and when the scow was got under command, and the sail was
properly trimmed, it was found that the direction was southerly,
inclining towards the eastern shore.  No better course offering
for the purposes of the party, the singular craft was suffered to
skim the surface of the water in this direction for more than hour,
when a change in the currents of the air drove them over towards
the camp.

Deerslayer watched all the movements of Hutter and Harry with
jealous attention.  At first, he did not know whether to ascribe
the course they held to accident or to design; but he now began to
suspect the latter.  Familiar as Hutter was with the lake, it was
easy to deceive one who had little practice on the water; and let
his intentions be what they might, it was evident, ere two hours
had elapsed, that the ark had got sufficient space to be within a
hundred rods of the shore, directly abreast of the known position
of the camp.  For a considerable time previously to reaching this
point, Hurry, who had some knowledge of the Algonquin language,
had been in close conference with the Indian, and the result was
now announced by the latter to Deerslayer, who had been a cold,
not to say distrusted, looker-on of all that passed.

"My old father, and my young brother, the Big Pine," - for so
the Delaware had named March - "want to see Huron scalps at their
belts," said Chingachgook to his friend.  "There is room for some
on the girdle of the Sarpent, and his people will look for them when
he goes back to his village.  Their eyes must not be left long in
a fog, but they must see what they look for.  I know that my brother
has a white hand; he will not strike even the dead.  He will wait
for us; when we come back, he will not hide his face from shame
for his friend.  The great Serpent of the Mohicans must be worthy
to go on the war-path with Hawkeye."

"Ay, ay, Sarpent, I see how it is; that name's to stick, and in
time I shall get to be known by it instead of Deerslayer; well, if
such honours will come, the humblest of us all must be willing to
abide by 'em.  As for your looking for scalps, it belongs to your
gifts, and I see no harm in it.  Be marciful, Sarpent, howsever;
be marciful, I beseech of you.  It surely can do no harm to a
red-skin's honour to show a little marcy.  As for the old man, the
father of two young women, who might ripen better feelin's in his
heart, and Harry March, here, who, pine as he is, might better bear
the fruit of a more Christianized tree, as for them two, I leave
them in the hands of the white man's God.  Wasn't it for the bloody
sticks, no man should go ag'in the Mingos this night, seein' that
it would dishonor our faith and characters; but them that crave
blood can't complain if blood is shed at their call.  Still, Sarpent,
you can be marciful.  Don't begin your career with the wails of
women and the cries of children.  Bear yourself so that Hist will
smile, and not weep, when she meets you.  Go, then; and the Manitou
presarve you!"

"My brother will stay here with the scow.  Wah will soon be standing
on the shore waiting, and Chingachgook must hasten."

The Indian then joined his two co-adventurers, and first lowering
the sail, they all three entered the canoe, and left the side of
the ark.  Neither Hutter nor March spoke to Deerslayer concerning
their object, or the probable length of their absence.  All this
had been confided to the Indian, who had acquitted himself of the
trust with characteristic brevity.  As soon as the canoe was out of
sight, and that occurred ere the paddles had given a dozen strokes,
Deerslayer made the best dispositions he could to keep the ark as
nearly stationary as possible; and then he sat down in the end of
the scow, to chew the cud of his own bitter reflections.  It was
not long, however, before he was joined by Judith, who sought every
occasion to be near him, managing her attack on his affections
with the address that was suggested by native coquetry, aided by
no little practice, but which received much of its most dangerous
power from the touch of feeling that threw around her manner, voice,
accents, thoughts, and acts, the indescribable witchery of natural
tenderness.  Leaving the young hunter exposed to these dangerous
assailants, it has become our more immediate business to follow
the party in the canoe to the shore.

The controlling influence that led Hutter and Hurry to repeat their
experiment against the camp was precisely that which had induced
the first attempt, a little heightened, perhaps, by the desire
of revenge.  But neither of these two rude beings, so ruthless in
all things that touched the rights and interests of the red man,
thought possessing veins of human feeling on other matters, was much
actuated by any other desire than a heartless longing for profit.
Hurry had felt angered at his sufferings, when first liberated, it
is true, but that emotion soon disappeared in the habitual love
of gold, which he sought with the reckless avidity of a needy
spendthrift, rather than with the ceaseless longings of a miser.
In short, the motive that urged them both so soon to go against
the Hurons, was an habitual contempt of their enemy, acting on
the unceasing cupidity of prodigality.  The additional chances of
success, however, had their place in the formation of the second
enterprise.  It was known that a large portion of the warriors
-perhaps all - were encamped for the night abreast of the castle,
and it was hoped that the scalps of helpless victims would be
the consequence.  To confess the truth, Hutter in particular - he
who had just left two daughters behind him - expected to find few
besides women and children in the camp.  The fact had been but
slightly alluded to in his communications with Hurry, and with
Chingachgook it had been kept entirely out of view.  If the Indian
thought of it at all, it was known only to himself.

Hutter steered the canoe; Hurry had manfully taken his post in the
bows, and Chingachgook stood in the centre.  We say stood, for all
three were so skilled in the management of that species of frail
bark, as to be able to keep erect positions in the midst of the
darkness.  The approach to the shore was made with great caution,
and the landing effected in safety.  The three now prepared their
arms, and began their tiger-like approach upon the camp.  The Indian
was on the lead, his two companions treading in his footsteps with
a stealthy cautiousness of manner that rendered their progress almost
literally noiseless.  Occasionally a dried twig snapped under the
heavy weight of the gigantic Hurry, or the blundering clumsiness
of the old man; but, had the Indian walked on air, his step could
not have seemed lighter.  The great object was first to discover
the position of the fire, which was known to be the centre of the
whole encampment.  At length the keen eye of Chingachgook caught a
glimpse of this important guide.  It was glimmering at a distance
among the trunks of trees.  There was no blaze, but merely a single
smouldering brand, as suited the hour; the savages usually retiring
and rising with the revolutions of the sun.

As soon as a view was obtained of this beacon, the progress of the
adventurers became swifter and more certain.  In a few minutes they
got to the edge of the circle of little huts.  Here they stopped to
survey their ground, and to concert their movements.  The darkness
was so deep as to render it difficult to distinguish anything but
the glowing brand, the trunks of the nearest trees, and the endless
canopy of leaves that veiled the clouded heaven.  It was ascertained,
however, that a hut was quite near, and Chingachgook attempted to
reconnnoitre its interior.  The manner in which the Indian approached
the place that was supposed to contain enemies, resembled the wily
advances of the cat on the bird.  As he drew near, he stooped to
his hands and knees, for the entrance was so low as to require this
attitude, even as a convenience.  Before trusting his head inside,
however, he listened long to catch the breathing of sleepers.  No
sound was audible, and this human Serpent thrust his head in at
the door, or opening, as another serpent would have peered in on
the nest.  Nothing rewarded the hazardous experiment; for, after
feeling cautiously with a hand, the place was found to be empty.

The Delaware proceeded in the same guarded manner to one or two more
of the huts, finding all in the same situation.  He then returned
to his companions, and informed them that the Hurons had deserted
their camp.  A little further inquiry corroborated this fact, and
it only remained to return to the canoe.  The different manner
in which the adventurers bore the disappointment is worthy of a
passing remark.  The chief, who had landed solely with the hope of
acquiring renown, stood stationary, leaning against a tree, waiting
the pleasure of his companions.  He was mortified, and a little
surprised, it is true; but he bore all with dignity, falling back
for support on the sweeter expectations that still lay in reserve
for that evening.  It was true, he could not now hope tomeet his
mistress with the proofs of his daring and skill on his person, but
he might still hope to meet her; and the warrior, who was zealous
in the search, might always hope to be honored.  On the other hand,
Hutter and Hurry, who had been chiefly instigated by the basest of
all human motives, the thirst of gain, could scarce control their
feelings.  They went prowling among the huts, as if they expected
to find some forgotten child or careless sleeper; and again and
again did they vent their spite on the insensible huts, several of
which were actually torn to pieces, and scattered about the place.
Nay, they even quarrelled with each other, and fierce reproaches
passed between them.  It is possible some serious consequences might
have occurred, had not the Delaware interfered to remind them of
the danger of being so unguarded, and of the necessity of returning
to the ark.  This checked the dispute, and in a few minutes they
were paddling sullenly back to the spot where they hoped to find
that vessel.

It has been said that Judith took her place at the side of Deerslayer,
soon after the adventurers departed.  For a short time the girl
was silent, and the hunter was ignorant which of the sisters had
approached him, but he soon recognized the rich, full-spirited
voice of the elder, as her feelings escaped in words.

"This is a terrible life for women, Deerslayer!" she exclaimed.
"Would to Heaven I could see an end of it!"

"The life is well enough, Judith," was the answer, "being pretty
much as it is used or abused.  What would you wish to see in its
place?"

"I should be a thousand times happier to live nearer to civilized
beings - where there are farms and churches, and houses built as
it might be by Christian hands; and where my sleep at night would
be sweet and tranquil!  A dwelling near on of the forts would be
far better than this dreary place where we live!"

"Nay, Judith, I can't agree too lightly in the truth of all this.
If forts are good to keep off inimies, they sometimes hold inimies
of their own.  I don't think 'twould be for your good, or the good
of Hetty, to live near one; and if I must say what I think, I'm
afeard you are a little too near as it is."  Deerslayer went on,
in his own steady, earnest manner, for the darkness concealed the
tints that colored the cheeks of the girl almost to the brightness
of crimson, while her own great efforts suppressed the sounds of
the breathing that nearly choked her.  "As for farms, they have
their uses, and there's them that like to pass their lives on 'em;
but what comfort can a man look for in a clearin', that he can't find
in double quantities in the forest?  If air, and room, and light,
are a little craved, the windrows and the streams will furnish
'em, or here are the lakes for such as have bigger longings in that
way; but where are you to find your shades, and laughing springs,
and leaping brooks, and vinerable trees, a thousand years old,
in a clearin'?  You don't find them, but you find their disabled
trunks, marking the 'arth like headstones in a graveyard.  It
seems to me that the people who live in such places must be always
thinkin' of their own inds, and of universal decay; and that, too,
not of the decay that is brought about by time and natur', but the
decay that follows waste and violence.  Then as to churches, they
are good, I suppose, else wouldn't good men uphold 'em.  But they
are not altogether necessary.  They call 'em the temples of the
Lord; but, Judith, the whole 'arth is a temple of the Lord to such
as have the right mind.  Neither forts nor churches make people
happier of themselves.  Moreover, all is contradiction in the
settlements, while all is concord in the woods.  Forts and churches
almost always go together, and yet they're downright contradictions;
churches being for peace, and forts for war.  No, no - give me
the strong places of the wilderness, which is the trees, and the
churches, too, which are arbors raised by the hand of natur'."

"Woman is not made for scenes like these, Deerslayer, scenes of
which we shall have no end, as long as this war lasts."

"If you mean women of white colour, I rather think you're not far
from the truth, gal; but as for the females of the redmen, such
visitations are quite in character.  Nothing would make Hist, now,
the bargained wife of yonder Delaware, happier than to know that
he is at this moment prowling around his nat'ral inimies, striving
after a scalp."

"Surely, surely, Deerslayer, she cannot be a woman, and not feel
concern when she thinks the man she loves is in danger!"

"She doesn't think of the danger, Judith, but of the honor; and
when the heart is desperately set on such feelin's, why, there is
little room to crowd in fear.  Hist is a kind, gentle, laughing,
pleasant creatur', but she loves honor, as well as any Delaware
gal I ever know'd.  She's to meet the Sarpent an hour hence, on the
p'int where Hetty landed, and no doubt she has her anxiety about
it, like any other woman; but she'd be all the happier did she know
that her lover was at this moment waylaying a Mingo for his scalp."

"If you really believe this, Deerslayer, no wonder you lay so
much stress on gifts.  Certain am I, that no white girl could feel
anything but misery while she believed her betrothed in danger of
his life!  Nor do I suppose even you, unmoved and calm as you ever
seem to be, could be at peace if you believed your Hist in danger."

"That's a different matter - 'tis altogether a different matter,
Judith.  Woman is too weak and gentle to be intended to run such
risks, and man must feel for her.  Yes, I rather think that's as
much red natur' as it's white.  But I have no Hist, nor am I like
to have; for I hold it wrong to mix colours, any way except in
friendship and sarvices."

"In that you are and feel as a white man should!  As for Hurry
Harry, I do think it would be all the same to him whether his wife
were a squaw or a governor's daughter, provided she was a little
comely, and could help to keep his craving stomach full."

"You do March injustice, Judith; yes, you do.  The poor fellow dotes
on you, and when a man has ra'ally set his heart on such a creatur'
it isn't a Mingo, or even a Delaware gal, that'll be likely to
unsettle his mind.  You may laugh at such men as Hurry and I, for
we're rough and unteached in the ways of books and other knowledge;
but we've our good p'ints, as well as our bad ones.  An honest
heart is not to be despised, gal, even though it be not varsed in
all the niceties that please the female fancy."

"You, Deerslayer!  And do you - can you, for an instant, suppose
I place you by the side of Harry March?  No, no, I am not so far
gone in dullness as that.  No one - man or woman - could think of
naming your honest heart, manly nature, and simple truth, with the
boisterous selfishness, greedy avarice, and overbearing ferocity of
Henry March.  The very best that can be said of him, is to be found
in his name of Hurry Skurry, which, if it means no great harm,
means no great good.  Even my father, following his feelings with
the other, as he is doing at this moment, well knows the difference
between you.  This I know, for he said as much to me, in plain
language."

Judith was a girl of quick sensibilities and of impetuous feelings;
and, being under few of the restraints that curtail the manifestations
of maiden emotions among those who are educated in the habits of
civilized life, she sometimes betrayed the latter with a feeling
that was so purely natural as to place it as far above the wiles of
coquetry as it was superior to its heartlessness.  She had now even
taken one of the hard hands of the hunter and pressed it between
both her own, with a warmth and earnestness that proved how sincere
was her language.  It was perhaps fortunate that she was checked by
the very excess of her feelings, since the same power might have
urged her on to avow all that her father had said - the old man
not having been satisfied with making a comparison favorable to
Deerslayer, as between the hunter and Hurry, but having actually,
in his blunt rough way, briefly advised his daughter to cast off the
latter entirely, and to think of the former as a husband.  Judith
would not willingly have said this to any other man, but there
was so much confidence awakened by the guileless simplicity of
Deerslayer, that one of her nature found it a constant temptation
to overstep the bounds of habit.  She went no further, however,
immediately relinquishing the hand, and falling back on a reserve
that was more suited to her sex, and, indeed, to her natural modesty.

"Thankee, Judith, thankee with all my heart," returned the hunter, whose
humility prevented him from placing any flattering interpretation
on either the conduct or the language of the girl.  "Thankee as much
as if it was all true.  Harry's sightly - yes, he's as sightly as
the tallest pine of the mountains, and the Sarpent has named him
accordingly; however, some fancy good looks, and some fancy good
conduct, only.  Hurry has one advantage, and it depends on himself
whether he'll have t'other or - Hark!  That's your father's voice,
gal, and he speaks like a man who's riled at something."

"God save us from any more of these horrible scenes!" exclaimed
Judith, bending her face to her knees, and endeavoring to exclude
the discordant sounds, by applying her hands to her ears.  "I
sometimes wish I had no father!"

This was bitterly said, and the repinings which extorted the words
were bitterly felt.  It is impossible to say what might next have
escaped her had not a gentle, low voice spoken at her elbow.

"Judith, I ought to have read a chapter to father and Hurry!" said
the innocent but terrified speaker, "and that would have kept them
from going again on such an errand.  Do you call to them, Deerslayer,
and tell them I want them, and that it will be good for them both
if they'll return and hearken to my words."

"Ah's me!  Poor Hetty, you little know the cravin's for gold and
revenge, if you believe they are so easily turned aside from their
longin's!  But this is an uncommon business in more ways than one,
Judith.  I hear your father and Hurry growling like bears, and yet
no noise comes from the mouth of the young chief.  There's an ind
of secrecy, and yet his whoop, which ought to ring in the mountains,
accordin' to rule in such sarcumstances, is silent!"

"Justice may have alighted on him, and his death have saved the
lives of the innocent."

"Not it - not it - the Sarpent is not the one to suffer if that's
to be the law.  Sartainly there has been no onset, and 'tis
most likely that the camp's deserted, and the men are comin' back
disapp'inted.  That accounts for the growls of Hurry and the silence
of the Sarpent."

Just at this instant a fall of a paddle was heard in the canoe,
for vexation made March reckless.  Deerslayer felt convinced that
his conjecture was true.  The sail being down, the ark had not
drifted far; and ere many minutes he heard Chingachgook, in a low,
quiet tone, directing Hutter how to steer in order to reach it.
In less time than it takes to tell the fact, the canoe touched the
scow, and the adventurers entered the latter.  Neither Hutter nor
Hurry spoke of what had occurred.  But the Delaware, in passing
his friend, merely uttered the words "fire's out," which, if not
literally true, sufficiently explained the truth to his listener.

It was now a question as to the course to be steered.  A short
surly conference was held, when Hutter decided that the wisest way
would be to keep in motion as the means most likely to defeat any
attempt at a surprise - announcing his own and March's intention
to requite themselves for the loss of sleep during their captivity,
by lying down.  As the air still baffled and continued light, it was
finally determined to sail before it, let it come in what direction
it might, so long as it did not blow the ark upon the strand.  This
point settled, the released prisoners helped to hoist the sail, and
they threw themselves upon two of the pallets, leaving Deerslayer
and his friend to look after the movements of the craft.  As neither
of the latter was disposed to sleep, on account of the appointment
with Hist, this arrangement was acceptable to all parties.  That
Judith and Hetty remained up also, in no manner impaired the
agreeable features of this change.

For some time the scow rather drifted than sailed along the western
shore, following a light southerly current of the air.  The progress
was slow - not exceeding a couple of miles in the hour - but the
two men perceived that it was not only carrying them towards the
point they desired to reach, but at a rate that was quite as fast
as the hour yet rendered necessary.  But little more was said the
while even by the girls; and that little had more reference to the
rescue of Hist than to any other subject.  The Indian was calm to
the eye, but as minute after minute passed, his feelings became
more and more excited, until they reached a state that might have
satisfied the demands of even the most exacting mistress.  Deerslayer
kept the craft as much in the bays as was prudent, for the double
purpose of sailing within the shadows of the woods, and of detecting
any signs of an encampment they might pass on the shore.  In this
manner they doubled one low point, and were already in the bay that
was terminated north by the goal at which they aimed.  The latter
was still a quarter of a mile distant, when Chingachgook came
silently to the side of his friend and pointed to a place directly
ahead.  A small fire was glimmering just within the verge of
the bushes that lined the shore on the southern side of the point
-leaving no doubt that the Indians had suddenly removed their camp
to the very place, or at least the very projection of land where
Hist had given them the rendezvous!



Chapter XVI


"I hear thee babbling to the vale Of sunshine and of flowers, But
unto me thou bring'st a tale Of visionary hours."

Wordsworth.

One discovery mentioned at the close of the preceding chapter
was of great moment in the eyes of Deerslayer and his friend.  In
the first place, there was the danger, almost the certainty, that
Hutter and Hurry would make a fresh attempt on this camp, should
they awake and ascertain its position.  Then there was the increased
risk of landing to bring off Hist; and there were the general
uncertainty and additional hazards that must follow from the
circumstance that their enemies had begun to change their positions.
As the Delaware was aware that the hour was near when he ought to
repair to the rendezvous, he no longer thought of trophies torn
from his foes, and one of the first things arranged between him and
his associate was to permit the two others to sleep on, lest they
should disturb the execution of their plans by substituting some
of their own.  The ark moved slowly, and it would have taken fully
a quarter of an hour to reach the point, at the rate at which
they were going, thus affording time for a little forethought.
The Indians, in the wish to conceal their fire from those who
were thought to be still in the castle, had placed it so near the
southern side of the point as to render it extremely difficult to
shut it in by the bushes, though Deerslayer varied the direction
of the scow both to the right and to the left, in the hope of being
able to effect that object.

"There's one advantage, Judith, in finding that fire so near the
water,"  he said, while executing these little manoeuvres, "since it
shows the Mingos believe we are in the hut, and our coming on 'em
from this quarter will be an unlooked for event.  But it's lucky
Harry March and your father are asleep, else we should have 'em
prowling after scalps ag'in.  Ha!  there - the bushes are beginning
to shut in the fire - and now it can't be seen at all !"

Deerslayer waited a little to make certain that he had at last
gained the desired position, when he gave the signal agreed on,
and Chingachgook let go the grapnel and lowered the sail.

The situation in which the ark now lay had its advantages and its
disadvantages.  The fire had been hid by sheering towards the shore,
and the latter was nearer, perhaps, than was desirable.  Still,
the water was known to be very deep further off in the lake, and
anchoring in deep water, under the circumstances in which the party
was placed, was to be avoided, if possible.  It was also believed
no raft could be within miles; and though the trees in the darkness
appeared almost to overhang the scow, it would not be easy to get
off to her without using a boat.  The intense darkness that prevailed
so close in with the forest, too, served as an effectual screen,
and so long as care was had not to make a noise, there was little
or no danger of being detected.  All these things Deerslayer pointed
out to Judith, instructing her as to the course she was to follow
in the event of an alarm; for it was thought to the last degree
inexpedient to arouse the sleepers, unless it might be in the
greatest emergency.

"And now, Judith, as we understand one another, it is time the
Sarpent and I had taken to the canoe," the hunter concluded.  "The
star has not risen yet, it's true, but it soon must, though none
of us are likely to be any the wiser for it tonight, on account
of the clouds.  Howsever, Hist has a ready mind, and she's one of
them that doesn't always need to have a thing afore her, to see it.
I'll warrant you she'll not be either two minutes or two feet out
of the way, unless them jealous vagabonds, the Mingos, have taken
the alarm, and put her as a stool-pigeon to catch us, or have hid
her away, in order to prepare her mind for a Huron instead of a
Mohican husband."

"Deerslayer," interrupted the girl, earnestly; "this is a most
dangerous service; why do you go on it, at all?"

"Anan!  - Why you know, gal, we go to bring off Hist, the Sarpent's
betrothed - the maid he means to marry, as soon as we get back to
the tribe."

"That is all right for the Indian - but you do not mean to marry
Hist - you are not betrothed, and why should two risk their lives
and liberties, to do that which one can just as well perform?"

"Ah - now I understand you, Judith - yes, now I begin to take the
idee.  You think as Hist is the Sarpent's betrothed, as they call
it, and not mine, it's altogether his affair; and as one man can
paddle a canoe he ought to be left to go after his gal alone!  But
you forget this is our ar'n'd here on the lake, and it would not
tell well to forget an ar'n'd just as the pinch came.  Then, if
love does count for so much with some people, particularly with
young women, fri'ndship counts for something, too, with other
some.  I dares to say, the Delaware can paddle a canoe by himself,
and can bring off Hist by himself, and perhaps he would like that
quite as well, as to have me with him; but he couldn't sarcumvent
sarcumventions, or stir up an ambushment, or fight with the savages,
and get his sweetheart at the same time, as well by himself as if
he had a fri'nd with him to depend on, even if that fri'nd is no
better than myself.  No - no - Judith, you wouldn't desert one that
counted on you, at such a moment, and you can't, in reason, expect
me to do it."

"I fear - I believe you are right, Deerslayer, and yet I wish you
were not to go!  Promise me one thing, at least, and that is, not
to trust yourself among the savages, or to do anything more than
to save the girl.  That will be enough for once, and with that you
ought to be satisfied."

"Lord bless you!  gal; one would thik it was Hetty that's talking,
and not the quick-witted and wonderful Judith Hutter!  But fright
makes the wise silly, and the strong weak.  Yes, I've seen proofs
of that, time and ag'in!  Well, it's kind and softhearted in you,
Judith, to feel this consarn for a fellow creatur', and I shall
always say that you are kind and of true feelings, let them that
envy your good looks tell as many idle stories of you as they may."

"Deerslayer!" hastily said the girl, interrupting him, though nearly
choked by her own emotions; "do you believe all you hear about a
poor, motherless girl?  Is the foul tongue of Harry Hurry to blast
my life?"

"Not it, Judith - not it.  I've told Hurry it wasn't manful to
backbite them he couldn't win by fair means; and that even an Indian
is always tender, touching a young woman's good name."

"If I had a brother, he wouldn't dare to do it!" exclaimed Judith,
with eyes flashing fire.  "But, finding me without any protector but
an old man, whose ears are getting to be as dull as his feelings,
he has his way as he pleases!"

"Not exactly that, Judith; no, not exactly that, neither!  No
man, brother or stranger, would stand by and see as fair a gal as
yourself hunted down, without saying a word in her behalf.  Hurry's
in 'arnest in wanting to make you his wife, and the little he does
let out ag'in you, comes more from jealousy, like, than from any
thing else.  Smile on him when he awakes, and squeeze his hand
only half as hard as you squeezed mine a bit ago, and my life on
it, the poor fellow will forget every thing but your comeliness.
Hot words don't always come from the heart, but oftener from the
stomach than anywhere else.  Try him, Judith, when he awakes, and
see the virtue of a smile."

Deerslayer laughed, in his own manner, as he concluded, and then he
intimated to the patient-looking, but really impatient Chingachgook,
his readiness to proceed.  As the young man entered the canoe, the
girl stood immovable as stone, lost in the musings that the language
and manner of the other were likely to produce.  The simplicity
of the hunter had completely put her at fault; for, in her narrow
sphere, Judith was an expert manager of the other sex; though in
the present instance she was far more actuated by impulses, in all
she had said and done, than by calculation.  We shall not deny that
some of Judith's reflections were bitter, though the sequel of the
tale must be referred to, in order to explain how merited, or how
keen were her sufferings.

Chingachgook and his pale-face friend set forth on their hazardous
and delicate enterprise, with a coolness and method that would have
done credit to men who were on their twentieth.  instead of being
on their first, war-path.  As suited his relation to the pretty
fugitive, in whose service they were engaged, the Indian took his
place in the head of the canoe; while Deerslayer guided its movements
in the stern.  By this arrangement, the former would be the first
to land, and of course, the first to meet his mistress.  The latter
had taken his post without comment, but in secret influenced by the
reflection that one who had so much at stake as the Indian, might
not possibly guide the canoe with the same steadiness and intelligence,
as another who had more command of his feelings.  From the instant
they left the side of the ark, the movements of the two adventurers
were like the manoeuvres of highly-drilled soldiers, who, for the
first time were called on to meet the enemy in the field.  As yet,
Chingachgook had never fired a shot in anger, and the debut of
his companion in warfare is known to the reader.  It is true, the
Indian had been hanging about his enemy's camp for a few hours, on
his first arrival, and he had even once entered it, as related in
the last chapter, but no consequences had followed either experiment.
Now, it was certain that an important result was to be effected,
or a mortifying failure was to ensue.  The rescue, or the continued
captivity of Hist, depended on the enterprise.  In a word, it was
virtually the maiden expedition of these two ambitious young forest
soldiers ; and while one of them set forth impelled by sentiments
that usually carry men so far, both had all their feelings of pride
and manhood enlisted in their success.

Instead of steering in a direct line to the point, then distant
from the ark less than a quarter of a mile, Deerslayer laid the
head of his canoe diagonally towards the centre of the lake, with
a view to obtain a position from which he might approach the shore,
having his enemies in his front only.  The spot where Hetty had
landed, and where Hist had promised to meet them, moreover, was on
the upper side of the projection rather than on the lower; and to
reach it would have required the two adventurers to double nearly
the whole point, close in with the shore, had not this preliminary
step been taken.  So well was the necessity for this measure
understood, that Chingachgook quietly paddled on, although it was
adopted without consulting him, and apparently was taking him in
a direction nearly opposite to that one might think he most wished
to go.  A few minutes sufficed, however, to carry the canoe the
necessary distance, when both the young men ceased paddling as it
were by instinctive consent, and the boat became stationary.  The
darkness increased rather than diminished, but it was still
possible, from the place where the adventurers lay, to distinguish
the outlines of the mountains.  In vain did the Delaware turn
his head eastward, to catch a glimpse of the promised star; for,
notwithstanding the clouds broke a little near the horizon in
that quarter of the heavens, the curtain continued so far drawn as
effectually to conceal all behind it.  In front, as was known by
the formation of land above and behind it, lay the point, at the
distance of about a thousand feet.  No signs of the castle could
be seen, nor could any movement in that quarter of the lake reach
the ear.  The latter circumstance might have been equally owing to
the distance, which was several miles, or to the fact that nothing
was in motion.  As for the ark, though scarcely farther from the
canoe than the point, it lay so completely buried in the shadows
of the shore, that it would not have been visible even had there
been many degrees more of light than actually existed.

The adventurers now held a conference in low voices, consulting
together as to the probable time.  Deerslayer thought it wanted
yet some minutes to the rising of the star, while the impatience
of the chief caused him to fancy the night further advanced, and
to believe that his betrothed was already waiting his appearance on
the shore.  As might have been expected, the opinion of the latter
prevailed, and his friend disposed himself to steer for the place
of rendezvous.  The utmost skill and precaution now became necessary in
the management of the canoe.  The paddles were lifted and returned
to the water in a noiseless manner; and when within a hundred
yards of the beach, Chingachgook took in his, altogether laying
his hand on his rifle in its stead.  As they got still more within
the belt of darkness that girded the woods, it was seen that they
were steering too far north, and the course was altered accordingly.
The canoe now seemed to move by instinct, so cautious and deliberate
were all its motions.  Still it continued to advance, until its
bows grated on the gravel of the beach, at the precise spot where
Hetty had landed, and whence her voice had issued, the previous
night, as the ark was passing.  There was, as usual, a narrow
strand, but bushes fringed the woods, and in most places overhung
the water.

Chingachgook stepped upon the beach, and cautiously examined it for
some distance on each side of the canoe.  In order to do this, he
was often obliged to wade to his knees in the lake, but no Hist
rewarded his search.  When he returned, he found his friend also on
the shore.  They next conferred in whispers, the Indian apprehending
that they must have mistaken the place of rendezvous.  But Deerslayer
thought it was probable they had mistaken the hour.  While he was
yet speaking, he grasped the arm of the Delaware, caused him to
turn his head in the direction of the lake, and pointed towards the
summits of the eastern mountains.  The clouds had broken a little,
apparently behind rather than above the hills, and the evening
star was glittering among the branches of a pine.  This was every
way a flattering omen, and the young men leaned on their rifles,
listening intently for the sound of approaching footsteps.  Voices
they often heard, and mingled with them were the suppressed cries
of children, and the low but sweet laugh of Indian women.  As the
native Americans are habitually cautious, and seldom break out in
loud conversation, the adventurers knew by these facts that they
must be very near the encampment.  It was easy to perceive that
there was a fire within the woods, by the manner in which some of
the upper branches of the trees were illuminated.  but it was not
possible, where they stood, to ascertain exactly how near it was to
themselves.  Once or twice, it seemed as if stragglers from around
the fire were approaching the place of rendezvous; but these
sounds were either altogether illusion, or those who had drawn near
returned again without coming to the shore.  A quarter of an hour
was passed in this state of intense expectation and anxiety, when
Deerslayer proposed that they should circle the point in the canoe;
and by getting a position close in, where the camp could be seen,
reconnoitre the Indians, and thus enable themselves to form some
plausible conjectures for the non-appearance of Hist.  The Delaware,
however, resolutely refused to quit the spot, reasonably enough
offering as a reason the disappointment of the girl, should she
arrive in his absence.  Deerslayer felt for his friend's concern,
and offered to make the circuit of the point by himself, leaving
the latter concealed in the bushes to await the occurrence of any
fortunate event that might favour his views.  With this understanding,
then, the parties separated.

As soon as Deerslayer was at his post again, in the stern of the
canoe, he left the shore with the same precautions, and in the
same noiseless manner, as he had approached it.  On this occasion
he did not go far from the land, the bushes affording a sufficient
cover, by keeping as close in as possible.  Indeed, it would not
have been easy to devise any means more favourable to reconnoitering
round an Indian camp, than those afforded by the actual state
of things.  The formation of the point permitted the place to be
circled on three of its sides, and the progress of the boat was
so noiseless as to remove any apprehensions from an alarm through
sound.  The most practised and guarded foot might stir a bunch of
leaves, or snap a dried stick in the dark, but a bark canoe could
be made to float over the surface of smooth water, almost with the
instinctive readiness, and certainly with the noiseless movements
of an aquatic bird.

Deerslayer had got nearly in a line between the camp and the ark
before he caught a glimpse of the fire.  This came upon him suddenly,
and a little unexpectedly, at first causing an alarm, lest he had
incautiously ventured within the circle of light it cast.  But
perceiving at a second glance that he was certainly safe from
detection, so long as the Indians kept near the centre of the
illumination, he brought the canoe to a state of rest in the most
favourable position he could find, and commenced his observations.

We have written much, but in vain, concerning this extraordinary
being, if the reader requires now to be told, that, untutored as
he was in the learning of the world, and simple as he ever showed
himself to be in all matters touching the subtleties of conventional
taste, he was a man of strong, native, poetical feeling.  He loved
the woods for their freshness, their sublime solitudes, their
vastness, and the impress that they everywhere bore of the divine
hand of their creator.  He seldom moved through them, without
pausing to dwell on some peculiar beauty that gave him pleasure,
though seldom attempting to investigate the causes; and never did
a day pass without his communing in spirit, and this, too, without
the aid of forms or language, with the infinite source of all he
saw, felt, and beheld.  Thus constituted, in a moral sense, and of
a steadiness that no danger could appall, or any crisis disturb,
it is not surprising that the hunter felt a pleasure at looking
on the scene he now beheld, that momentarily caused him to forget
the object of his visit.  This will more fully appear when we
describe it.

The canoe lay in front of a natural vista, not only through the
bushes that lined the shore, but of the trees also, that afforded
a clear view of the camp.  It was by means of this same opening
that the light had been first seen from the ark.  In consequence
of their recent change of ground, the Indians had not yet retired
to their huts, but had been delayed by their preparations, which
included lodging as well as food.  A large fire had been made,
as much to answer the purpose of torches as for the use of their
simple cookery; and at this precise moment it was blazing high and
bright, having recently received a large supply of dried brush.
the effect was to illuminate the arches of the forest, and to
render the whole area occupied by the camp as light as if hundreds
of tapers were burning.  Most of the toil had ceased, and even the
hungriest child had satisfied its appetite.  In a word, the time
was that moment of relaxation and general indolence which is apt to
succeed a hearty meal, and when the labours of the day have ended.
The hunters and the fishermen had been totally successful; and
food, that one great requisite of savage life, being abundant,
every other care appeared to have subsided in the sense of enjoyment
dependent on this all-important fact.

Deerslayer saw at a glance that many of the warriors were absent.
His acquaintance Rivenoak, however, was present, being seated in
the foreground of a picture that Salvator Rosa would have delighted
to draw, his swarthy features illuminated as much by pleasure as
by the torchlike flame, while he showed another of the tribe one of
the elephants that had caused so much sensation among his people.
A boy was looking over his shoulder, in dull curiosity, completing
the group.  More in the background eight or ten warriors lay half
recumbent on the ground, or sat with their backs reclining against
trees, so many types of indolent repose.  Their arms were near
them all, sometimes leaning against the same trees as themselves,
or were lying across their bodies in careless preparation.  But
the group that most attracted the attention of Deerslayer was that
composed of the women and children.  A1l the females appeared to
be collected together, and, almost as a matter of course, their
young were near them.  The former laughed and chatted in their
rebuked and quiet manner, though one who knew the habits of the
people might have detected that everything was not going on in its
usual train.  Most of the young women seemed to be light-hearted
enough; but one old hag was seated apart with a watchful soured
aspect, which the hunter at once knew betokened that some duty of
an unpleasant character had been assigned her by the chiefs.  What
that duty was, he had no means of knowing; but he felt satisfied it
must be in some measure connected with her own sex, the aged among
the women generally being chosen for such offices and no other.

As a matter of course, Deerslayer looked eagerly and anxiously
for the form of Hist.  She was nowhere
