ll paid, you know.

LAMACHUS
But I propose always to war with the Peloponnesians, both at sea, on land
and everywhere to make them tremble, and trounce them soundly.

DICAEOPOLIS
For my own part, I make proclamation to all Peloponnesians,
Megarians and Boeotians, that to them my markets are open; but I debar
Lamachus from entering them.

CHORUS
Convinced by this man's speech, the folk have changed their view
and approve him for having concluded peace.  But let us prepare for the
recital of the parabasis.[1]

Never since our poet presented Comedies, has he praised himself
upon the stage; but, having been slandered by his enemies amongst
the volatile Athenians, accused of scoffing at his country and of
insulting the people, to-day he wishes to reply and regain for himself
the inconstant Athenians.  He maintains that he has done much that is
good for you; if you no longer allow yourselves to be too much
hoodwinked by strangers or seduced by flattery, if in politics you are
no longer the ninnies you once were, it is thanks to him.  Formerly,
when delegates from other cities wanted to deceive you, they had but
to style you, "the people crowned with violets," and at the word
"violets" you at once sat erect on the tips of your bums.  Or if, to
tickle your vanity, someone spoke of "rich and sleek Athens," in
return for that "sleekness" he would get all, because he spoke of you
as he would have of anchovies in oil.  In cautioning you against
such wiles, the poet has done you great service as well as
in forcing you to understand what is really the democratic
principle.  Thus, the strangers, who came to pay their tributes,
wanted to see this great poet, who had dared to speak the truth to
Athens.  And so far has the fame of his boldness reached that one day
the Great King, when questioning the Lacedaemonian delegates, first
asked them which of the two rival cities was the superior at sea,
and then immediately demanded at which it was that the comic poet
directed his biting satire.  "Happy that city," he added, "if it
listens to his counsel; it will grow in power, and its victory is
assured." This is why the Lacedaemonians offer you peace, if you
will cede them Aegina; not that they care for the isle, but they
wish to rob you of your poet.[2] As for you, never lose him, who will
always fight for the cause of justice in his Comedies; he promises you
that his precepts will lead you to happiness, though he uses neither
flattery, nor bribery, nor intrigue, nor deceit; instead of loading
you with praise, he will point you to the better way.  I scoff at
Cleon's tricks and plotting; honesty and justice shall fight my cause;
never will you find me a political poltroon, a prostitute to the
highest bidder.

I invoke thee, Acharnian Muse, fierce and fell as the devouring fire;
sudden as the spark that bursts from the crackling oaken coal when
roused by the quickening fan to fry little fishes, while others knead
the dough or whip the sharp Thasian pickle with rapid hand, so break
forth, my Muse, and inspire thy tribesmen with rough, vigorous,
stirring strains.

We others, now old men and heavy with years, we reproach the city;
so many are the victories we have gained for the Athenian fleets
that we well deserve to be cared for in our declining life; yet far
from this, we are ill-used, harassed with law-suits, delivered over to
the scorn of stripling orators.  Our minds and bodies being ravaged
with age, Posidon should protect us, yet we have no other support than
a staff.  When standing before the judge, we can scarcely stammer forth
the fewest words, and of justice we see but its barest shadow, whereas
the accuser, desirous of conciliating the younger men, overwhelms us
with his ready rhetoric; he drags us before the judge, presses us with
questions, lays traps for us; the onslaught troubles, upsets and ruins
poor old Tithonus, who, crushed with age, stands tongue-tied;
sentenced to a fine,[3] he weeps, he sobs and says to his friend,
"This fine robs me of the last trifle that was to have bought my coffin."

Is this not a scandal?  What! the clepsydra[4] is to kill the
white-haired veteran, who, in fierce fighting, has so oft covered
himself with glorious sweat, whose valour at Marathon saved the
country!  'Twas we who pursued on the field of Marathon,
whereas now 'tis wretches who pursue us to the death and crush us!
What would Marpsias reply to this?[5] What an injustice that a man,
bent with age like Thucydides, should be brow-beaten by this braggart
advocate, Cephisodemus,[6] who is as savage as the Scythian desert
he was born in! Is it not to convict him from the outset?  I wept tears
of pity when I saw an Archer[7] maltreat this old man, who, by Ceres,
when he was young and the true Thucydides, would not have permitted
an insult from Ceres herself!  At that date he would have floored
ten orators, he would have terrified three thousand Archers with his
shouts; he would have pierced the whole line of the enemy with his shafts.
Ah!  but if you will not leave the aged in peace, decree that the advocates
be matched; thus the old man will only be confronted with a toothless
greybeard, the young will fight with the braggart, the ignoble
with the son of Clinias;[8] make a law that in the future, the old man
can only be summoned and convicted at the courts by the aged
and the young man by the youth.

f[1] The 'parabasis' in the Old Comedy was a sort of address or topical
harangue addressed directly by the poet, speaking by the Chorus,
to the audience.  It was nearly always political in bearing, and the subject
of the particular piece was for the time being set aside altogether.
f[2] It will be remembered that Aristophanes owned land in Aegina.
f[3] Everything was made the object of a law-suit in Athens.  The old
soldiers, inexpert at speaking, often lost the day.
f[4] A water-clock used to limit the length of speeches in the courts.
f[5] A braggart speaker, fiery and pugnacious.
f[6] Cephisodemus was an Athenian, but through his mother possessed
Scythian blood.
f[7] The city of Athens was policed by Scythian archers.
f[8] Alcibiades.

DICAEOPOLIS
These are the confines of my market-place.  All Peloponnesians,
Megarians, Boeotians, have the right to come and trade here,
provided they sell their wares to me and not to Lamachus.  As
market-inspectors I appoint these three whips of Leprean[1] leather,
chosen by lot.  Warned away are all informers and all men of Phasis.[2]
They are bringing me the pillar on which the treaty is inscribed[3] and
I shall erect it in the centre of the market, well in sight of all.

f[1] The leather market was held in Lepros, outside the city.
f[2] Mean an informer ([from the Greek] 'to denounce').
f[3] According to the Athenian custom.

A MEGARIAN
Hail! market of Athens, beloved of Megarians.  Let Zeus, the patron
of friendship, witness, I regretted you as a mother mourns her son.
Come, poor little daughters of an unfortunate father, try to find
something to eat; listen to me with the full heed of an empty belly.
Which would you prefer?  To be sold or to cry with hunger?

DAUGHTERS
To be sold, to be sold!

MEGARIAN
That is my opinion too.  But who would make so sorry a deal as to
buy you?  Ah! I recall me a Megarian trick; I am going to disguise
you as little porkers, that I am offering for sale.  Fit your hands
with these hoofs and take care to appear the issue of a sow of good
breed, for, if I am forced to take you back to the house, by Hermes!
you will suffer cruelly of hunger!  Then fix on these snouts and cram
yourselves into this sack.  Forget not to grunt and to say wee-wee like
the little pigs that are sacrificed in the Mysteries.  I must summon
Dicaeopolis.  Where is be?  Dicaeopolis, do you want to buy
some nice little porkers?

DICAEOPOLIS
Who are you?  a Megarian?

MEGARIAN
I have come to your market.

DICAEOPOLIS
Well, how are things at Megara?[1]

f[1] Megara was allied to Sparta and suffered during the war more than
any other city because of its proximity to Athens.

MEGARIAN
We are crying with hunger at our firesides.

DICAEOPOLIS
The fireside is jolly enough with a piper.  But what else is
doing at Megara, eh?

MEGARIAN
What else?  When I left for the market, the authorities were taking
steps to let us die in the quickest manner.

DICAEOPOLIS
That is the best way to get you out of all your troubles.

MEGARIAN
True.

DICAEOPOLIS
What other news of Megara?  What is wheat selling at?

MEGARIAN
With us it is valued as highly as the very gods in heaven!

DICAEOPOLIS
Is it salt that you are bringing?

MEGARIAN
Are you not holding back the salt?

DICAEOPOLIS
'Tis garlic then?

MEGARIAN
What! garlic!  do you not at every raid grub up the ground with your
pikes to pull out every single head?

DICAEOPOLIS
What DO you bring then?

MEGARIAN
Little sows, like those they immolate at the Mysteries.

DICAEOPOLIS
Ah! very well, show me them.

MEGARIAN
They are very fine; feel their weight.  See! how fat and fine.

DICAEOPOLIS
But what is this?

MEGARIAN
A SOW, for a certainty.[1]

f[1] Throughout this whole scene there is an obscene play upon [a] word
which means in Greek both 'sow' and 'a woman's organs of generation.'

DICAEOPOLIS
You say a sow!  Of what country, then?

MEGARIAN
 From Megara.  What! is it not a sow then?

DICAEOPOLIS
No, I don't believe it is.

MEGARIAN
This is too much!  what an incredulous man!  He says 'tis not a sow;
but we will stake, an you will, a measure of salt ground up with
thyme, that in good Greek this is called a sow and nothing else.

DICAEOPOLIS
But a sow of the human kind.

MEGARIAN
Without question, by Diocles! of my own breed!  Well! What think
you?  will you hear them squeal?

DICAEOPOLIS
Well, yes, I' faith, I will.

MEGARIAN
Cry quickly, wee sowlet; squeak up, hussy, or by Hermes! I take you
back to the house.

GIRL
Wee-wee, wee-wee!

MEGARIAN
Is that a little sow, or not?

DICAEOPOLIS
Yes, it seems so; but let it grow up, and it will be a fine fat bitch.

MEGARIAN
In five years it will be just like its mother.

DICAEOPOLIS
But it cannot be sacrificed.

MEGARIAN
And why not?

DICAEOPOLIS
It has no tail.[1]

f[1] Sacrificial victims were bound to be perfect in every part; an animal,
therefore, without a tail could not be offered.

MEGARIAN
Because it is quite young, but in good time it will have a big one,
thick and red.

DICAEOPOLIS
The two are as like as two peas.

MEGARIAN
They are born of the same father and mother; let them be fattened,
let them grow their bristles, and they will be the finest sows you can
offer to Aphrodite.

DICAEOPOLIS
But sows are not immolated to Aphrodite.

MEGARIAN
Not sows to Aphrodite!  Why, 'tis the only goddess to whom they
are offered!  the flesh of my sows will be excellent on the spit.

DICAEOPOLIS
Can they eat alone?  They no longer need their mother!

MEGARIAN
Certainly not, nor their father.

DICAEOPOLIS
What do they like most?

MEGARIAN
Whatever is given them; but ask for yourself.

DICAEOPOLIS
Speak! little sow.

DAUGHTER
Wee-wee, wee-wee!

DICAEOPOLIS
Can you eat chick-pease?

DAUGHTER
Wee-wee, wee-wee, wee-wee!

DICAEOPOLIS
And Attic figs?

DAUGHTER
Wee-wee, wee-wee!

DICAEOPOLIS
What sharp squeaks at the name of figs.  Come, let some figs be
brought for these little pigs.  Will they eat them?  Goodness! how
they munch them, what a grinding of teeth, mighty Heracles! I
believe those pigs hail from the land of the Voracians.  But surely
'tis impossible they have bolted all the figs!

MEGARIAN
Yes, certainly, bar this one that I took from them.

DICAEOPOLIS
Ah! what funny creatures!  For what sum will you sell them?

MEGARIAN
I will give you one for a bunch of garlic, and the other, if you
like, for a quart measure of salt.

DICAEOPOLIS
I buy them of you.  Wait for me here.

MEGARIAN
The deal is done.  Hermes, god of good traders, grant I may sell
both my wife and my mother in the same way!

AN INFORMER
Hi! fellow, what countryman are you?

MEGARIAN
I am a pig-merchant from Megara.

INFORMER
I shall denounce both your pigs and yourself as public enemies.

MEGARIAN
Ah! here our troubles begin afresh!

INFORMER
Let go that sack.  I will punish your Megarian lingo![1]

f[1] The Megarians used the Doric dialect.

MEGARIAN
Dicaeopolis, Dicaeopolis, they want to denounce me.

DICAEOPOLIS
Who dares do this thing?  Inspectors, drive out the informers.
Ah! you offer to enlighten us without a lamp![1]

f[1] A play upon [a] word which both means 'to light' and 'to denounce.'

INFORMER
What! I may not denounce our enemies?

DICAEOPOLIS
Have a care for yourself, if you don't go off pretty quick to denounce
elsewhere.

MEGARIAN
What a plague to Athens!

DICAEOPOLIS
Be reassured, Megarian.  Here is the price for your two swine,
the garlic and the salt.  Farewell and much happiness!

MEGARIAN
Ah! we never have that amongst us.

DICAEOPOLIS
Well! may the inopportune wish apply to myself.

MEGARIAN
Farewell, dear little sows, and seek, far from your father, to
munch your bread with salt, if they give you any.

CHORUS
Here is a man truly happy.  See how everything succeeds to his
wish.  Peacefully seated in his market, he will earn his living; woe to
Ctesias,[1] and all other informers who dare to enter there!  You will not
be cheated as to the value of wares, you will not again see Prepis[2]
wiping his foul rump, nor will Cleonymus[3] jostle you; you will take your
walks, clothed in a fine tunic, without meeting Hyperbolus[4] and his
unceasing quibblings, without being accosted on the public place by
any importunate fellow, neither by Cratinus,[5] shaven in the fashion
of the debauchees, nor by this musician, who plagues us with his silly
improvisations, Artemo, with his arm-pits stinking as foul as a goat,
like his father before him.  You will not be the butt of the villainous
Pauson's[6] jeers, nor of Lysistratus,[7] the disgrace
of the Cholargian deme, who is the incarnation of all the vices,
and endures cold and hunger more than thirty days in the month.

f[1] An informer (sycophant), otherwise unknown.
f[2] A debauchee of vile habits; a pathic.
f[3] Mentioned above; he was as proud as he was cowardly.
f[4] An Athenian general, quarrelsome and litigious, and an Informer
into the bargain.
f[5] A comic poet of vile habits.
f[6] A painter.
f[7] A debauchee, a gambler, and always in extreme poverty.

A BOEOTIAN
By Heracles! my shoulder is quite black and blue.  Ismenias, put
the penny-royal down there very gently, and all of you, musicians
from Thebes, pipe with your bone flutes into a dog's rump.[1]

f[1] This kind of flute had a bellows, made of dog-skin, much like
the bagpipes of to-day.

DICAEOPOLIS
Enough, enough, get you gone.  Rascally hornets, away with you!
Whence has sprung this accursed swarm of Charis[1] fellows which comes
assailing my door?

f[1] A flute-player, mentioned above.

BOEOTIAN
Ah!  by Iolas![1] Drive them off, my dear host, you will please me
immensely; all the way from Thebes, they were there piping behind me
and have completely stripped my penny-royal of its blossom.
But will you buy anything of me, some chickens or some locusts?

f[1] A hero, much honoured in Thebes; nephew of Heracles.

DICAEOPOLIS
Ah! good day, Boeotian, eater of good round loaves.[1] What do you
bring?

f[1] A form of bread peculiar to Boeotia.

BOEOTIAN
All that is good in Boeotia, marjoram, penny-royal, rush-mats,
lamp-wicks, ducks, jays, woodcocks, water-fowl, wrens, divers.

DICAEOPOLIS
'Tis a very hail of birds that beats down on my market.

BOEOTIAN
I also bring geese, hares, foxes, moles, hedgehogs, cats, lyres,
martins, otters and eels from the Copaic lake.[1]
f[1] A lake in Boeotia.

DICAEOPOLIS
Ah! my friend, you, who bring me the most delicious of fish,
let me salute your eels.

BOEOTIAN
Come, thou, the eldest of my fifty Copaic virgins, come and
complete the joy of our host.

DICAEOPOLIS
Oh! my well-beloved, thou object of my long regrets, thou art here
at last then, thou, after whom the comic poets sigh, thou, who art
dear to Morychus.[1]  Slaves, hither with the stove and the bellows.
Look at this charming eel, that returns to us after six long years
of absence.[2]  Salute it, my children; as for myself, I will supply
coal to do honour to the stranger.  Take it into my house; death itself
could not separate me from her, if cooked with beet leaves.
f[1] He was the Lucullus of Athens.
f[2] This again fixes the date of the presentation of 'The 
Acharnians' to 436 B.C., the sixth  year of the War, since the 
beginning of which Boeotia had been closed to the Athenians.

BOEOTIAN
And what will you give me in return?

DICAEOPOLIS
It will pay for your market dues.  And as to the rest, what do
you wish to sell me?

BOEOTIAN
Why, everything.

DICAEOPOLIS
On what terms?  For ready-money or in wares from these parts?

BOEOTIAN
I would take some Athenian produce, that we have not got
in Boeotia.

DICAEOPOLIS
Phaleric anchovies, pottery?

BOEOTIAN
Anchovies, pottery?  But these we have.  I want produce that is
wanting with us and that is plentiful here.

DICAEOPOLIS
Ah! I have the very thing; take away an Informer, packed up
carefully as crockery-ware.

BOEOTIAN
By the twin gods!  I should earn big money, if I took one; I
would exhibit him as an ape full of spite.

DICAEOPOLIS
Hah! here we have Nicarchus,[1] who comes to denounce you.
f[1] An informer.

BOEOTIAN
How small he is!

DICAEOPOLIS
But in his case the whole is one mass of ill-nature.

NICARCHUS
Whose are these goods?

DICAEOPOLIS
Mine; they come from Boeotia, I call Zeus to witness.

NICARCHUS
I denounce them as coming from an enemy's country.

BOEOTIAN
What! you declare war against birds?

NICARCHUS
And I am going to denounce you too.

BOEOTIAN
What harm have I done you?

NICARCHUS
I will say it for the benefit of those that listen; you introduce lamp-wicks
from an enemy's country.

DICAEOPOLIS
Then you go as far as denouncing a wick.

NICARCHUS
It needs but one to set an arsenal afire.

DICAEOPOLIS
A wick set an arsenal ablaze!  But how, great gods?

NICARCHUS
Should a Boeotian attach it to an insect's wing, and, taking
advantage of a violent north wind, throw it by means of a tube into
the arsenal and the fire once get hold of the vessels, everything
would soon be devoured by the flames.

DICAEOPOLIS
Ah! wretch! an insect and a wick devour everything!
(HE STRIKES HIM.)

NICARCHUS (TO THE CHORUS)
You will bear witness, that he mishandles me.

DICAEOPOLIS
Shut his mouth.  Give me some hay; I am going to pack him up like
a vase, that he may not get broken on the road.

CHORUS
Pack up your goods carefully, friend; that the stranger may not
break it when taking it away.

DICAEOPOLIS
I shall take great care with it, for one would say he is cracked already;
he rings with a false note, which the gods abhor.

CHORUS
But what will be done with him?

DICAEOPOLIS
This is a vase good for all purposes; it will be used as a vessel for holding
all foul things, a mortar for pounding together law-suits, a lamp
for spying upon accounts, and as a cup for the mixing up and poisoning
of everything.

CHORUS
None could ever trust a vessel for domestic use that has such a
ring about it.

DICAEOPOLIS
Oh! it is strong, my friend, and will never get broken, if care is
taken to hang it head downwards.

CHORUS
There! it is well packed now!

BOEOTIAN
Marry, I will proceed to carry off my bundle.

CHORUS
Farewell, worthiest of strangers, take this informer, good for
anything, and fling him where you like.

DICAEOPOLIS
Bah! this rogue has given me enough trouble to pack!  Here!
Boeotian, pick up your pottery.

BOEOTIAN
Stoop, Ismenias, that I may put it on your shoulder, and be very
careful with it.

DICAEOPOLIS
You carry nothing worth having; however, take it, for you will
profit by your bargain; the Informers will bring you luck.

A SERVANT OF LAMACHUS
Dicaeopolis!

DICAEOPOLIS
What do you want crying this gait?

SERVANT
Lamachus wants to keep the Feast of Cups,[1] and I come by his order
to bid you one drachma for some thrushes and three more for a Copaic eel.

f[1] The second day of the Dionysia or feasts of Bacchus, kept in the month
Anthesterion (February), and called the Anthesteria.  They lasted three
days; the second being the Feast of Cups, the third the Feast of Pans.
Vases, filled with grain of all kinds, were borne in procession and
dedicated to Hermes.

DICAEOPOLIS
And who is this Lamachus, who demands an eel?

SERVANT
'Tis the terrible, indefatigable Lamachus, who is always brandishing
his fearful Gorgon's head and the three plumes which o'ershadow
his helmet.

DICAEOPOLIS
No, no, he will get nothing, even though he gave me his buckler.
Let him eat salt fish, while he shakes his plumes, and, if he comes
here making any din, I shall call the inspectors.  As for myself,
I shall take away all these goods; I go home on thrushes' wings
and black-birds' pinions.[1]

f[1] A parody on some verses from a lost poet.

CHORUS
You see, citizens, you see the good fortune which this man owes to
his prudence, to his profound wisdom.  You see how, since he has
concluded peace, he buys what is useful in the household and good to
eat hot.  All good things flow towards him unsought.  Never will I welcome
the god of war in my house; never shall he chant the "Harmodius" at
my table;[1] he is a sot, who comes feasting with those who are
overflowing with good things and brings all manner of mischief at his
heels. He overthrows, ruins, rips open; 'tis vain to make him a 
thousand offers, "be seated, pray, drink this cup, proffered in all 
friendship," he burns our vine-stocks and brutally pours out the wine 
from our vineyards
on the ground.  This man, on the other hand, covers his table with
a thousand dishes; proud of his good fortunes, he has had these feathers
cast before his door to show us how he lives.

f[1] A feasting song in honour of Harmodius, the assassin of Hipparchus
the Tyrant, son of Pisistratus.

DICAEOPOLIS
Oh, Peace! companion of fair Aphrodite and of the sweet Graces,
how charming are thy features and yet I never knew it!  Would that Eros
might join me to thee, Eros, crowned with roses as Zeuxis[1] shows him to
us!  Perhaps I seem somewhat old to you, but I am yet able to make you a
threefold offering; despite my age I could plant a long row of vines for you;
then beside these some tender cuttings from the fig; finally a young
vine-stock, loaded with fruit and all around the field olive trees, which
would furnish us with oil, wherewith to anoint us both at the New Moons.

f[1] The celebrated painter, born in Heraclea, a contemporary
of Aristophanes.

HERALD
List, ye people!  As was the custom of your forebears, empty a full
pitcher of wine at the call of the trumpet; he, who first sees the
bottom, shall get a wine-skin as round and plump as Ctesiphon's belly.

DICAEOPOLIS
Women, children, have you not heard?  Faith! do you not heed the
herald?  Quick! let the hares boil and roast merrily; keep them
a-turning; withdraw them from the flame; prepare the chaplets;
reach me the skewers that I may spit the thrushes.

CHORUS
I envy you your wisdom and even more your good cheer.

DICAEOPOLIS
What then will you say when you see the thrushes roasting?

CHORUS
Ah! true indeed!

DICAEOPOLIS
Slave! stir up the fire.

CHORUS
See, how he knows his business, what a perfect cook!  How well
he understands the way to prepare a good dinner!

A HUSBANDMAN
Ah! woe is me!

DICAEOPOLIS
Heracles! What have we here?

HUSBANDMAN
A most miserable man.

DICAEOPOLIS
Keep your misery for yourself.

HUSBANDMAN
Ah! friend! since you alone are enjoying peace, grant me a part
of your truce, were it but five years.

DICAEOPOLIS
What has happened to you?

HUSBANDMAN
I am ruined; I have lost a pair of steers.

DICAEOPOLIS
How?

HUSBANDMAN
The Boeotians seized them at Phyle.[1]

f[1] A deme and frontier fortress of Attica, near the Boeotian border.

DICAEOPOLIS
Ah! poor wretch! and yet you have not left off white?

HUSBANDMAN
Their dung made my wealth.

DICAEOPOLIS
What can I do in the matter?

HUSBANDMAN
Crying for my beasts has lost me my eyesight.  Ah! if you care for poor
Dercetes of Phyle, anoint mine eyes quickly with your balm of peace.

DICAEOPOLIS
But, my poor fellow, I do not practise medicine.

HUSBANDMAN
Come, I adjure you; perhaps I shall recover my steers.

DICAEOPOLIS
'Tis impossible; away, go and whine to the disciples of Pittalus.[1]

f[1] An Athenian physician of the day.

HUSBANDMAN
Grant me but one drop of peace; pour it into this reedlet.

DICAEOPOLIS
No, not a particle; go a-weeping elsewhere.

HUSBANDMAN
Oh! oh! oh! my poor beasts!

CHORUS
This man has discovered the sweetest enjoyment in peace; he will share it
with none.

DICAEOPOLIS
Pour honey over this tripe; set it before the fire to dry.

CHORUS
What lofty tones he uses!  Did you hear him?

DICAEOPOLIS
Get the eels on the gridiron!

CHORUS
You are killing me with hunger; your smoke is choking your
neighbours, and you split our ears with your bawling.

DICAEOPOLIS
Have this fried and let it be nicely browned.

A BRIDESMAID
Dicaeopolis!  Dicaeopolis!

DICAEOPOLIS
Who are you?

BRIDESMAID
A young bridegroom sends you these viands from the marriage feast.

DICAEOPOLIS
Whoever he be, I thank him.

BRIDESMAID
And in return, he prays you to pour a glass of peace into this vase,
that he may not have to go to the front and may stay at home
to do his duty to his young wife.

DICAEOPOLIS
Take back, take back your viands; for a thousand drachmae I
would not give a drop of peace; but who are you, pray?

BRIDESMAID
I am the bridesmaid; she wants to say something to you
from the bride privately.

DICAEOPOLIS
Come, what do you wish to say?  (THE BRIDESMAID WHISPERS IN
HIS EAR.)  Ah! what a ridiculous demand!  The bride burns with longing
to keep by her her husband's weapon.  Come! \bring hither my truce; to
her alone will I give some of it, for she is a woman, and, as such,
should not suffer under the war.  Here, friend, reach hither your vial.
And as to the manner of applying this balm, tell the bride, when a
levy of soldiers is made to rub some in bed on her husband, where
most needed.  There, slave, take away my truce!  Now, quick, bring me
the wine-flagon, that I may fill up the drinking bowls!

CHORUS
I see a man, striding along apace, with knitted brows; he seems
to us the bearer of terrible tidings.

HERALD
Oh! toils and battles, 'tis Lamachus!

LAMACHUS
What noise resounds around my dwelling, where shines the glint
of arms.

HERALD
The Generals order you forthwith to take your battalions and
your plumes, and, despite the snow, to go and guard our borders.
They have learnt that a band of Boeotians intend taking advantage
of the Feast of Cups to invade our country.

LAMACHUS
Ah! the Generals! they are numerous, but not good for much!
It's cruel, not to be able to enjoy the feast!

DICAEOPOLIS
Oh! warlike host of Lamachus!

LAMACHUS
Wretch! do you dare to jeer me?

DICAEOPOLIS
Do you want to fight this four-winged Geryon?

LAMACHUS
Oh! oh! what fearful tidings!

DICAEOPOLIS
Ah! ah! I see another herald running up; what news does he bring me?

HERALD
Dicaeopolis!

DICAEOPOLIS
What is the matter?

HERALD
Come quickly to the feast and bring your basket and your cup;
'tis the priest of Bacchus who invites you.  But hasten, the guests
have been waiting for you a long while.  All is ready--couches,
tables, cushions, chaplets, perfumes, dainties and courtesans to boot;
biscuits, cakes, sesame-bread, tarts, lovely dancing women, the sweetest
charm of the festivity.  But come with all haste.

LAMACHUS
Oh! hostile gods!

DICAEOPOLIS
This is not astounding; you have chosen this huge, great ugly Gorgon's head
for your patron.  You, shut the door, and let someone get ready the meal.

LAMACHUS
Slave! slave! my knapsack!

DICAEOPOLIS
Slave! slave! a basket!

LAMACHUS
Take salt and thyme, slave, and don't forget the onions.

DICAEOPOLIS
Get some fish for me; I cannot bear onions.

LAMACHUS
Slave, wrap me up a little stale salt meat in a fig-leaf.

DICAEOPOLIS
And for me some good greasy tripe in a fig-leaf; I will have it cooked here.

LAMACHUS
Bring me the plumes for my helmet.

DICAEOPOLIS
Bring me wild pigeons and thrushes.

LAMACHUS
How white and beautiful are these ostrich feathers!

DICAEOPOLIS
How fat and well browned is the flesh of this wood-pigeon!

LAMACHUS
Bring me the case for my triple plume.

DICAEOPOLIS

Pass me over that dish of hare.

LAMACHUS
OH! the moths have eaten the hair of my crest.

DICAEOPOLIS
I shall always eat hare before dinner.

LAMACHUS
Hi! friend! try not to scoff at my armor?

DICAEOPOLIS
Hi! friend! will you kindly not stare at my thrushes.

LAMACHUS
Hi! friend! will you kindly not address me.

DICAEOPOLIS
I do not address you; I am scolding my slave.  Shall we wager and submit
the matter to Lamachus, which of the two is the best to eat, a locust or
a thrush?

LAMACHUS
Insolent hound!

DICAEOPOLIS
He much prefers the locusts.

LAMACHUS
Slave, unhook my spear and bring it to me.

DICAEOPOLIS
Slave, slave, take the sausage from the fire and bring it to me.

LAMACHUS
Come, let me draw my spear from its sheath.  Hold it, slave, hold it tight.

DICAEOPOLIS
And you, slave, grip, grip well hold of the skewer.

LAMACHUS
Slave, the bracings for my shield.

DICAEOPOLIS
Pull the loaves out of the oven and bring me these bracings of my stomach.

LAMACHUS
My round buckler with the Gorgon's head.

DICAEOPOLIS
My round cheese-cake.

LAMACHUS
What clumsy wit!

DICAEOPOLIS
What delicious cheese-cake!

LAMACHUS
Pour oil on the buckler.  Hah! hah! I can see reflected there an old
man who will be accused of cowardice.

DICAEOPOLIS
Pour honey on the cake.  Hah! hah! I can see an old man who makes
Lamachus of the Gorgon's head weep with rage.

LAMACHUS
Slave, full war armour.

DICAEOPOLIS
Slave, my beaker; that is MY armour.

LAMACHUS
With this I hold my ground with any foe.

DICAEOPOLIS
And I with this with any tosspot.

LAMACHUS
Fasten the strappings to the buckler; personally I shall carry the knapsack

DICAEOPOLIS
Pack the dinner well into the basket; personally I shall carry the cloak.

LAMACHUS
Slave, take up the buckler and let's be off.  It is snowing!  Ah!
'tis a question of facing the winter.

DICAEOPOLIS
Take up the basket, 'tis a question of getting to the feast.


CHORUS
We wish you both joy on your journeys, which differ so much.  One goes
to mount guard and freeze, while the other will drink, crowned
with flowers, and then sleep with a young beauty, who will excite
him readily.

I say it freely; may Zeus confound Antimachus, the poet-historian,
the son of Psacas!  When Choregus at the Lenaea, alas! alas! he
dismissed me dinnerless.  May I see him devouring with his eyes a
cuttle-fish, just served, well cooked, hot and properly salted; and
the moment that he stretches his hand to help himself, may a dog seize
it and run off with it.  Such is my first wish.  I also hope for him a
misfortune at night.  That returning all-fevered from horse practice,
he may meet an Orestes,[1] mad with drink, who breaks open his head;
that wishing to seize a stone, he, in the dark, may pick up a fresh stool,
hurl his missile, miss aim and hit Cratinus.[2]

f[1] An allusion to the paroxysms of rage, as represented in many tragedies
familiar to an Athenian audience, of Orestes, the son of Agamemnon,
after he had killed his mother.
f[2] No doubt the comic poet, rival of Aristophanes.

SLAVE OF LAMACHUS
Slaves of Lamachus!  Water, water in a little pot!  Make it warm, get ready
cloths, cerate greasy wool and bandages for his ankle.  In leaping a ditch,
the master has hurt himself against a stake; he has dislocated and twisted
his ankle, broken his head by falling on a stone, while his Gorgon shot far
away from his buckler.  His mighty braggadocio plume rolled on the
ground; at this sight he uttered these doleful words, "Radiant star, I gaze
on thee for the last time; my eyes close to all light, I die." Having 
said this,
he falls into the water, gets out again, meets some runaways and pursues
the robbers with his spear at their backsides.[1] But here he comes,
himself. Get the door open.

f[1] Unexpected wind-up of the story.  Aristophanes intends to deride
the boasting of Lamachus, who was always ascribing to himself most
unlikely exploits.

LAMACHUS
Oh! heavens! oh! heavens! What cruel pain!  I faint, I tremble!  Alas!
I die!  the foe's lance has struck me!  But what would hurt me most
would be for Dicaeopolis to see me wounded thus and laugh
at my ill-fortune.

DICAEOPOLIS (ENTERS WITH TWO COURTESANS)
Oh!  my gods!  what bosoms!  Hard as a quince!  Come, my treasures, give
me voluptuous kisses!  Glue your lips to mine.  Haha! I was the first to
empty my cup.

LAMACHUS
Oh! cruel fate! how I suffer!  accursed wounds!

DICAEOPOLIS
Hah! hah! hail! Knight Lamachus!  (EMBRACES LAMACHUS.)

LAMACHUS
By the hostile gods!  (BITES DICAEOPOLIS.)

DICAEOPOLIS
Ah! Great gods!

LAMACHUS
Why do you embrace me?

DICAEOPOLIS
And why do you bite me?

LAMACHUS
'Twas a cruel score I was paying back!

DICAEOPOLIS
Scores are not evened at the Feast of Cups!

LAMACHUS
Oh! Paean, Paean!

DICAEOPOLIS
But to-day is not the feast of Paean.

LAMACHUS
Oh! support my leg, do; ah! hold it tenderly, my friends!

DICAEOPOLIS
And you, my darlings, take hold of this, both of you!

LAMACHUS
This blow with the stone makes me dizzy; my sight grows dim.

DICAEOPOLIS
For myself, I want to get to bed; I am bursting with lustfulness,
I want to be bundling in the dark.

LAMACHUS
Carry me to the surgeon Pittalus.

DICAEOPOLIS
Take me to the judges.  Where is the king of the feast?
The wine-skin is mine!

LAMACHUS
That spear has pierced my bones; what torture I endure!

DICAEOPOLIS
You see this empty cup!  I triumph! I triumph!

CHORUS
Old man, I come at your bidding!  You triumph! you triumph!

DICAEOPOLIS
Again I have brimmed my cup with unmixed wine and drained it at
a draught!

CHORUS
You triumph then, brave champion; thine is the wine-skin!

DICAEOPOLIS
Follow me, singing "Triumph! Triumph!"

CHORUS
Aye!  we will sing of thee, thee and thy sacred wine-skin, and we all,
as we follow thee, will repeat in thine honour, "Triumph, Triumph!"

BASIC BACKGROUND

Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528) was probably the greatest
graphical artist of the Northern Renaissance.  He is the
first to have elevated the self-portrait to a high art form,
and was known for his fascination with animals, which form
the subjects of many of his graphical works.  He reveled in
portraying men of learning and/or high stature as well as
peasants, believing that portraits of the latter could be as
instructive as those of the former.  His marriage to his
wife Agnes was childless and banal, apparently because Dürer
was too preoccupied with intellectual matters to be much
interested in romantic pursuits.

In the letters below, this unusually modern thinker
demonstrates his noble, righteous utilitarian personal
philosophy, and meticulously records his personal and travel
expenses, while journeying throughout Venice and various
other European cities and divided German states.  Numerous
kings and laypeople sought to meet and host him, since he
was renowned and loved as a painter while still alive. He
comments on Martin Luther, Erasmus of Rotterdam and
painting, and demonstrates his curious, inquiring nature. He
also describes his visit to Zeeland to see a beached whale,
which washed away before he got there; but during this
visit, Dürer may have caught the disease from which he may
have died several years later.  Like Rembrandt, he enjoyed
collecting things, and demonstrates this in his letters.

                    ***********

BRIEF EXCERPT FROM THE INTRODUCTION TO THE 1913 EDITION,
WRITTEN BY ROGER FRY (1866-1934):

Whatever one's final estimate of his art, Dürer's
personality is at once so imposing and so attractive, and
has been so endeared to us by familiarity, that something of
this personal attachment has been transferred to our
aesthetic judgment.  The letters from Venice and the Diary
of his journey in the Netherlands, which form the contents
of this volume, are indeed the singularly fortunate means
for this pleasant intercourse with the man himself. They
reveal Dürer as one of the distinctively modern men of the
Renaissance: intensely, but not arrogantly, conscious of his
own personality; accepting with a pleasant ease the
universal admiration of his genius-a personal admiration,
too, of an altogether modern kind; careful of his fame as
one who foresaw its immortality. They show him as having,
though in a far less degree, something of Leonardo da
Vinci's scientific interest, certainly as possessing a
quick, though naive curiosity about the world and a quite
modern freedom from superstition. It is clear that his
dominating and yet kindly personality, no less than his
physical beauty and distinction, made him the center of
interest wherever he went. His easy and humorous good-
fellowship, of which the letters to Pirkheimer are eloquent,
won for him the admiring friendship of the best men of his
time.

To all these characteristics we must add a deep and sincere
religious feeling, which led him to side with the leaders of
the Reformation, a feeling which comes out in his passionate
sense of loss when he thinks that Luther is about to be put
to death, and causes him to write a stirring letter to
Erasmus, urging him to continue the work of reform. For all
that, there is no trace in him of either Protestantism or
Puritanism. He was perhaps fortunate--certainly as an artist
he was fortunate--to live at a time when the line of
cleavage between the reformers and the Church was not yet so
marked as to compel a decisive action.

PART 1: LETTERS FROM VENICE TO WILIBALD PIRKHEIMER

Venice, 6th January, 1506

To the Honourable and wise Wilibald Pirkheimer, in
Nuremberg.

My dear Master, To you and all yours, many happy good New
Years. My willing service to you, dear Herr Pirkheimer. Know
that I am in good health; may God send you better even than
that. Now as to what you commissioned me, namely, to buy a
few pearls and precious stones, you must know that I can
find nothing good enough or worth the money: everything is
snapped up by the Germans.

Those who go about on the Riva always expect four times the
value for anything, for they are the falsest knaves that
live there. No one expects to get an honest service of them.
For that reason some good people warned me to be on my guard
against them. They told me that they cheat both man and
beast, and that you could buy better things for less money
at Frankfort than at Venice.

As for the books which I was to order for you, Imhof has
already seen to it, but if you are in need of anything else,
let me know, and I shall do it for you with all zeal.  And
would to God that I could do you some real good service. I
should gladly accomplish it, since I know how much you do
for me.

And I beg of you be patient with my debt, for I think
oftener of it than you do. As soon as God helps me to get
home I will pay you honourably, with many thanks; for I have
to paint a picture for the Germans, for which they are
giving me 110 Rhenish gulden, which will not cost me as much
as five. I shall have finished laying and scraping the
ground-work in eight days, then I shall at once begin to
paint, and if God will, it shall be in its place for the
altar a month after Easter.

[Editor note: This refers to the [altarpiece called the]
"Madonna of the Rose Garlands," painted for the chapel of S.
Bartolommeo, the burial-place of the German colony. About
the year 1600 it was bought for a high price by the Emperor
Rudolf II, who is said to have had it carried [over the
Alps] by four men all the way to Prague to avoid the risk of
damage in transport. [It suffered serious water damage
during the Thirty Years' War of 1618-1648, and many parts of
it had to be repainted to replace much of the original paint
that was lost, but] it still remains one of the most
important [and lavishly colored] of all Dürer's works.]

The money I hope, if God will, to put by; and from that I
will pay you: for I think that I need not send my mother and
wife any money at present; I left 10 florins with my mother
when I came away; she has since got 9 or 10 florins by
selling works of art. Dratzieher has paid her 12 florins,
and I have sent her 9 florins by Sebastian Imhof, of which
she has to pay Pfinzing and Gartner 7 florins for rent. I
gave my wife 12 florins and she got 13 more at Frankfort,
making all together 25 florins, so I don't think she will be
in any need, and if she does want anything, her brother will
have to help her, until I come home, when I will repay him
honourably. Herewith let me commend myself to you.

Given at Venice on the day of the Holy Three Kings
(Epiphany), the year 1506.  Greet for me Stephen Paumgartner
and my other good friends who ask after me.

--Albrecht Dürer



7th February, 1506

First my willing service to you, dear Master.  If it is well
with you, I am as whole-heartedly glad as I should be for
myself. I wrote to you recently. I hope the letter reached
you. In the meantime my mother has written to me, chiding me
for not writing to you, and has given me to understand that
you are displeased with me because I do not write to you;
and that I must excuse myself to you fully. And she is much
worried about it, as is her wont. Now I do not know what
excuse to make, except that I am lazy about writing and that
you have not been at home. But as soon as I knew that you
were at home or were coming home, I wrote to you at once; I
also specially charged Castel (Fugger) to convey my service
to you. Therefore I most humbly beg you to forgive me, for I
have no other friend on earth but you; but I do not believe
you are angry with me, for I hold you as no other than a
father.

How I wish you were here at Venice, there are so many good
fellows among the Italians who seek my company more and more
every day--which is very gratifying to me--men of sense, and
scholarly, good lute-players, and pipers, connoisseurs in
painting, men of much noble sentiment and honest virtue, and
they show me much honour and friendship. On the other hand,
there are also amongst them the most faithless, lying,
thievish rascals; such as I scarcely believed could exist on
earth; and yet if one did not know them, one would think
that they were the nicest men on earth. I cannot help
laughing to myself when they talk to me: they know that
their villainy is well known, but that does not bother them.

I have many good friends among the Italians who warn me not
to eat and drink with their painters, for many of them are
my enemies and copy my work in the churches and wherever
they can find it; afterwards they criticize it and claim
that it is not done in the antique style and say it is no
good, but Giambellin (Giovanni Bellini) has praised me
highly to many gentlemen. He would willingly have something
of mine, and came himself to me and asked me to do something
for him, and said that he would pay well for it, and
everyone tells me what an upright man he is, so that I am
really friendly with him. He is very old and yet he is the
best painter of all.

[Editor's note: The character of Bellini agrees with all we
know of him. Camerarius tells an amusing story of the two
artists, to the effect that Bellini once asked Dürer for one
of the brushes with which he painted hairs. Dürer produced
several quite ordinary brushes and offered them to Bellini.
Bellini replied that he did not mean those, but some brush
with the hairs divided which would enable him to draw a
number of fine parallel lines such as Dürer did. Dürer
assured him that he used no special kind, and proceeded to
draw a number of long wavy lines like tresses with such
absolute regularity and parallelism that Bellini declared
that nothing but seeing it done would have convinced him
that such a feat of skill was possible.]

And the thing which pleased me so well eleven years ago
pleases me no longer, and if I had not seen it myself, I
would not have believed anyone who told me. And you must
know too that there are many better painters here than
Master Jacob (Jacopo de Barbari), though Antonio Kolb would
take an oath that there was no better painter on earth than
Jacob. Others sneer at him and say if he were any good, he
would stay here. I have only today begun the sketch of my
picture, for my hands are so scabby that I could not work,
but I have cured them.

And now be lenient with me and do not get angry so quickly,
but be gentile like me. You will not learn from me, I do not
know why. My dear, I should like to know whether any of your
loves is dead--that one close by the water, for instance, or
the one like [drawing of a flower] or [drawing of a brush]
or [drawing of a running dog]'s girl so that you might get
another in her stead.

Given at Venice at the ninth hour of the night on Saturday
after Candlemas in the year 1506.  [Editor's note: Reckoning
from sunset, at this season [this] would be about 2:30 a.m.]
Give my service to Stephen Paumgartner and to Masters Hans
Harsdorfer and Volkamer.

--Albrecht Dürer



28th February, 1506

First my willing service to you, dear Herr Pirkheimer. If
things go well with you, then I am indeed glad. Know, too,
that by the grace of God I am doing well and working fast.
Still I do not expect to have finished before Whitsuntide.
I have sold all my pictures except one. For two I got 24
ducats, and the other three I gave for these three rings,
which were valued in the exchange as worth 24 ducats, but I
have shown them to some good friends and they say they are
only worth 22, and as you wrote to me to buy you some
jewels, I thought that I would send you the rings by Franz
Imhof. Show them to people who understand them, and if you
like them, keep them for what they are worth. In case you do
not want them, send them back by the next messenger, for
here at Venice a man who helped to make the exchange will
give me 12 ducats for the emerald and 10 ducats for the ruby
and diamond, so that I need not lose more than 2 ducats.

I wish you had occasion to come here, I know the time would
pass quickly, for there are so many nice men here, real
artists. And I have such a crowd of foreigners (Italians)
about me that I am forced sometimes to shut myself up, and
the gentlemen all wish me well, but few of the painters.

Dear Master, Andreas Kunhofer sends you his service and
means to write to you by the next courier. Herewith let me
be commended to you, and I also commend my mother to you. I
am wondering greatly why she has not written to me for so
long, and as for my wife, I begin to think that I have lost
her, and I am surprised too that you do not write to me, but
I have read the letter which you wrote to Sebastian Imhof
about me. Please give the two enclosed letters to my mother,
and have patience, I pray, till God brings me home, when I
will honourably repay you. My greetings to Stephen
Pirkheimer and other good friends, and let me know if any of
your loves are dead. Read this according to the sense: I am
hurried.

Given in Venice, the Sunday before Whitsunday, the year
1506.

--Albrecht Dürer

[p.s.] Tomorrow it is good to confess.



8th March, 1506

First my willing service to you, dear Herr Pirkheimer. I
send you herewith a ring with a sapphire about which you
wrote so urgently. I could not send it sooner, for the past
two days I have been running around to all the German and
Italian goldsmiths that are in all Venice with a good
assistant whom I hired: and we made comparisons, but were
unable to match this one at the price, and only after much
entreaty could I get it for 18 ducats 4 marcelli from a man
who was wearing it on his own hand and who let me have it as
a favour, as I gave him to understand that I wanted it for
myself. And as soon as I had bought it a German goldsmith
wanted to give me 3 ducats more for it than I paid, so I
hope that you will like it. Everybody says that it is a good
stone, and that in Germany it would be worth about 50
florins; however, you will know whether they tell truth or
lies. I understand nothing about it. I had first of all
bought an amethyst for 12 ducats from a man whom I thought
was a good friend, but he deceived me, for it was not worth
7; but the matter was arranged between us by some good
fellows: I will give him back the stone and make him a
present of a dish of fish. I was glad to do so and took my
money back quickly. As my good friend values the ring, the
stone is not worth much more than 10 Rhenish florins, whilst
the gold of the ring weighs about up to 5 florins, so that I
have not gone beyond the limit set me, as you wrote "from 15
to 20 florins." But the other stone I have not yet been able
to buy, for 10 one finds them rarely in pairs; but I will do
all I can about it. They say here that such trumpery fool's
work is to be had cheaper in Germany, especially now at the
Frankfurt Fair. For the Italians take such stuff abroad, and
they laugh at me, especially about the jacinth cross, when I
speak of 2 ducats, so write quickly and tell me what I am to
do. I have heard of a good diamond ornament in a certain
place, but I do not yet know what it will cost. I shall buy
it for you until you write again, for emeralds are as dear
as anything I have seen in all my days. It is easy enough
for anyone to get a small amethyst if he thinks it worth 20
or 25 ducats.

It really seems to me you must have taken a mistress; only
beware you don't get a master.  But you are wise enough
about your own affairs.

Dear Pirkheimer, Andreas Kunhofer sends you his service. He
intends in the meantime to write to you, and he prays you if
necessary to explain for him to the Council why he does not
stay at Padua; he says there is nothing there for him to
learn. Don't be angry I pray you with me for not sending all
the stones on this occasion, for I could not get them all
ready. My friends tell me that you should have the stone set
with a new foil and it will look twice as good again, for
the ring is old, and the foil spoiled. And I beg you too to
tell my mother to write me soon and have good care of
herself. Herewith I commend myself to you.

Given at Venice on the second Sunday in Lent, 1506.

--Albrecht Dürer

[p.s.] Greetings to your loves.



2nd April, 1506

First my willing service to you, dear  Sir.

I received a letter from you on the Thursday before Palm
Sunday, together with the emerald ring, and went immediately
to the man from whom I got the rings. He will give me back
my money for it, although it is a thing that he does not
like to do; however, he has given me his word and he must
hold to that. Do you know that the je
