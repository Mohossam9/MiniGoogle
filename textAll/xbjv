 the evil in
the face, and don't mistake his gifts and his obligations."

Hurry, in the main, was a good-hearted as well as good-natured
fellow; and the self-abasement of his companion completely got the
better of the passing feeling of personal vanity.  He regretted
the allusion he had made to the other's appearance, and endeavored
to express as much, though it was done in the uncouth manner that
belonged to the habits and opinions of the frontier.

"I meant no harm, Deerslayer," he answered, in a deprecating
manner, "and hope you'll forget what I've said.  If you're not
downright handsome, you've a sartain look that says, plainer than
any words, that all's right within.  Then you set no value by looks,
and will the sooner forgive any little slight to your appearance.
I will not say that Jude will greatly admire you, for that might
raise hopes that would only breed disapp'intment; but there's Hetty,
now, would be just as likely to find satisfaction in looking at
you, as in looking at any other man.  Then you're altogether too
grave and considerate-like, to care much about Judith; for, though
the gal is oncommon, she is so general in her admiration, that a
man need not be exalted because she happens to smile.  I sometimes
think the hussy loves herself better than she does anything else
breathin'."

"If she did, Hurry, she'd do no more, I'm afeard, than most queens
on their thrones, and ladies in the towns," answered Deerslayer,
smiling, and turning back towards his companion with every trace
of feeling banished from his honest-looking and frank countenance.
"I never yet know'd even a Delaware of whom you might not say
that much.  But here is the end of the long p'int you mentioned,
and the 'Rat's Cove' can't be far off."

This point, instead of thrusting itself forward, like all the
others, ran in a line with the main shore of the lake, which here
swept within it, in a deep and retired bay, circling round south
again, at the distance of a quarter of a mile, and crossed the
valley, forming the southern termination of the water.  In this
bay Hurry felt almost certain of finding the ark, since, anchored
behind the trees that covered the narrow strip of the point, it
might have lain concealed from prying eyes an entire summer.  So
complete, indeed, was the cover, in this spot, that a boat hauled
close to the beach, within the point, and near the bottom of the
bay, could by any possibility be seen from only one direction; and
that was from a densely wooded shore within the sweep of the water,
where strangers would be little apt to go.

"We shall soon see the ark," said Hurry, as the canoe glided round
the extremity of the point, where the water was so deep as actually
to appear black; "he loves to burrow up among the rushes, and we
shall be in his nest in five minutes, although the old fellow may
be off among the traps himself."

March proved a false prophet.  The canoe completely doubled the
point, so as to enable the two travellers to command a view of
the whole cove or bay, for it was more properly the last, and no
object, but those that nature had placed there, became visible.
The placid water swept round in a graceful curve, the rushes bent
gently towards its surface, and the trees overhung it as usual;
but all lay in the soothing and sublime solitude of a wilderness.
The scene was such as a poet or an artist would have delighted in,
but it had no charm for Hurry Harry, who was burning with impatience
to get a sight of his light-minded beauty.

The motion of the canoe had been attended with little or no noise,
the frontiermen habitually getting accustomed to caution in most
of their movements, and it now lay on the glassy water appearing
to float in air, partaking of the breathing stillness that seemed
to pervade the entire scene.  At this instant a dry stick was heard
cracking on the narrow strip of land that concealed the bay from
the open lake.  Both the adventurers started, and each extended a
hand towards his rifle, the weapon never being out of reach of the
arm.

"'Twas too heavy for any light creatur'," whispered Hurry, "and it
sounded like the tread of a man!"

"Not so- not so," returned Deerslayer; "'t was, as you say, too
heavy for one, but it was too light for the other.  Put your paddle
in the water, and send the canoe in, to that log; I'll land and
cut off the creatur's retreat up the p'int, be it a Mingo, or be
it a muskrat."

As Hurry complied, Deerslayer was soon on the shore, advancing into
the thicket with a moccasined foot, and a caution that prevented
the least noise.  In a minute he was in the centre of the narrow
strip of land, and moving slowly down towards its end, the bushes
rendering extreme watchfulness necessary.  Just as be reached the
centre of the thicket the dried twigs cracked again, and the noise
was repeated at short intervals, as if some creature having life
walked slowly towards the point.  Hurry heard these sounds also,
and pushing the canoe off into the bay, he seized his rifle to
watch the result.  A breathless minute succeeded, after which a
noble buck walked out of the thicket, proceeded with a stately step
to the sandy extremity of the point, and began to slake his thirst
from the water of the lake.  Hurry hesitated an instant; then raising
his rifle hastily to his shoulder, he took sight and fired.  The
effect of this sudden interruption of the solemn stillness of such
a scene was not its least striking peculiarity.  The report of the
weapon had the usual sharp, short sound of the rifle: but when a
few moments of silence had succeeded the sudden crack, during which
the noise was floating in air across the water, it reached the
rocks of the opposite mountain, where the vibrations accumulated,
and were rolled from cavity to cavity for miles along the hills,
seeming to awaken the sleeping thunders of the woods.  The buck
merely shook his head at the report of the rifle and the whistling
of the bullet, for never before had he come in contact with man;
but the echoes of the hills awakened his distrust, and leaping
forward, with his four legs drawn under his body, he fell at once
into deep water, and began to swim towards the foot of the lake.
Hurry shouted and dashed forward in chase, and for one or two
minutes the water foamed around the pursuer and the pursued.  The
former was dashing past the point, when Deerslayer appeared on the
sand and signed to him to return.

"'Twas inconsiderate to pull a trigger, afore we had reconn'itred
the shore, and made sartain that no inimies harbored near it,"
said the latter, as his companion slowly and reluctantly complied.
"This much I have l'arned from the Delawares, in the way of schooling
and traditions, even though I've never yet been on a war-path.  And,
moreover, venison can hardly be called in season now, and we do
not want for food.  They call me Deerslayer, I'll own, and perhaps
I desarve the name, in the way of understanding the creatur's
habits, as well as for some sartainty in the aim, but they can't
accuse me of killing an animal when there is no occasion for the meat,
or the skin.  I may be a slayer, it's true, but I'm no slaughterer."

"'Twas an awful mistake to miss that buck!" exclaimed Hurry, doffing
his cap and running his fingers through his handsome but matted
curls, as if he would loosen his tangled ideas by the process.
"I've not done so onhandy a thing since I was fifteen."

"Never lament it, as the creatur's death could have done neither
of us any good, and might have done us harm.  Them echoes are more
awful in my ears, than your mistake, Hurry, for they sound like the
voice of natur' calling out ag'in a wasteful and onthinking action."

"You'll hear plenty of such calls, if you tarry long in this quarter
of the world, lad," returned the other laughing.  "The echoes repeat
pretty much all that is said or done on the Glimmerglass, in this
calm summer weather.  If a paddle falls you hear of it sometimes,
ag'in and ag'in, as if the hills were mocking your clumsiness, and
a laugh, or a whistle, comes out of them pines, when they're in
the humour to speak, in a way to make you believe they can r'ally
convarse."

"So much the more reason for being prudent and silent.  I do not
think the inimy can have found their way into these hills yet, for
I don't know what they are to gain by it, but all the Delawares
tell me that, as courage is a warrior's first vartue, so is prudence
his second.  One such call from the mountains, is enough to let a
whole tribe into the secret of our arrival."

"If it does no other good, it will warn old Tom to put the pot
over, and let him know visiters are at hand.  Come, lad; get into
the canoe, and we will hunt the ark up, while there is yet day."

Deerslayer complied, and the canoe left the spot.  Its head was
turned diagonally across the lake, pointing towards the south-eastern
curvature of the sheet.  In that direction, the distance to the
shore, or to the termination of the lake, on the course the two
were now steering, was not quite a mile, and, their progress being
always swift, it was fast lessening under the skilful, but easy
sweeps of the paddles.  When about half way across, a slight noise
drew the eyes of the men towards the nearest land, and they saw
that the buck was just emerging from the lake and wading towards
the beach.  In a minute, the noble animal shook the water from
his flanks, gazed up ward at the covering of trees, and, bounding
against the bank, plunged into the forest.

"That creatur' goes off with gratitude in his heart," said Deerslayer,
"for natur' tells him he has escaped a great danger.  You ought to
have some of the same feelin's, Hurry, to think your eye wasn't
true, or that your hand was onsteady, when no good could come of
a shot that was intended onmeaningly rather than in reason."

"I deny the eye and the hand," cried March with some heat.  "You've
got a little character, down among the Delawares, there, for quickness
and sartainty, at a deer, but I should like to see you behind one
of them pines, and a full painted Mingo behind another, each with
a cock'd rifle and a striving for the chance!  Them's the situations,
Nathaniel, to try the sight and the hand, for they begin with trying
the narves.  I never look upon killing a creatur' as an explite;
but killing a savage is.  The time will come to try your hand, now
we've got to blows ag'in, and we shall soon know what a ven'son
reputation can do in the field.  I deny that either hand or eye
was onsteady; it was all a miscalculation of the buck, which stood
still when he ought to have kept in motion, and so I shot ahead of
him."

"Have it your own way, Hurry; all I contend for is, that it's
lucky.  I dare say I shall not pull upon a human mortal as steadily
or with as light a heart, as I pull upon a deer."

"Who's talking of mortals, or of human beings at all, Deerslayer?
I put the matter to you on the supposition of an Injin.  I dare say
any man would have his feelin's when it got to be life or death,
ag'in another human mortal; but there would be no such scruples in
regard to an Injin; nothing but the chance of his hitting you, or
the chance of your hitting him."

"I look upon the redmen to be quite as human as we are ourselves,
Hurry.  They have their gifts, and their religion, it's true;
but that makes no difference in the end, when each will be judged
according to his deeds, and not according to his skin."

"That's downright missionary, and will find little favor up in
this part of the country, where the Moravians don't congregate.
Now, skin makes the man.  This is reason; else how are people to
judge of each other.  The skin is put on, over all, in order when
a creatur', or a mortal, is fairly seen, you may know at once what
to make of him.  You know a bear from a hog, by his skin, and a
gray squirrel from a black."

"True, Hurry," said the other looking back and smiling, "nevertheless,
they are both squirrels."

"Who denies it?  But you'll not say that a red man and a white
man are both Injins?"

"But I do say they are both men.  Men of different races and colors,
and having different gifts and traditions, but, in the main, with
the same natur'.  Both have souls; and both will be held accountable
for their deeds in this life."

Hurry was one of those theorists who believed in the inferiority of
all the human race who were not white.  His notions on the subject
were not very clear, nor were his definitions at all well settled;
but his opinions were none the less dogmatical or fierce.  His
conscience accused him of sundry lawless acts against the Indians,
and he had found it an exceedingly easy mode of quieting it,
by putting the whole family of redmen, incontinently, without the
category of human rights.  Nothing angered him sooner than to deny
his proposition, more especially if the denial were accompanied
by a show of plausible argument; and he did not listen to his
companion's remarks with much composure of either manner or feeling.

"You're a boy, Deerslayer, misled and misconsaited by Delaware arts,
and missionary ignorance," he exclaimed, with his usual indifference
to the forms of speech, when excited.  "You may account yourself
as a red-skin's brother, but I hold'em all to be animals; with
nothing human about 'em but cunning.  That they have, I'll allow;
but so has a fox, or even a bear.  I'm older than you, and have
lived longer in the woods- or, for that matter, have lived always
there, and am not to be told what an Injin is or what he is not.
If you wish to be considered a savage, you've only to say so, and
I'll name you as such to Judith and the old man, and then we'll
see how you'll like your welcome."

Here Hurry's imagination did his temper some service, since, by
conjuring up the reception his semi-aquatic acquaintance would be
likely to bestow on one thus introduced, he burst into a hearty fit
of laughter.  Deerslayer too well knew the uselessness of attempting
to convince such a being of anything against his prejudices, to
feel a desire to undertake the task; and he was not sorry that the
approach of the canoe to the southeastern curve of the lake gave
a new direction to his ideas.  They were now, indeed, quite near
the place that March had pointed out for the position of the outlet,
and both began to look for it with, a curiosity that was increased
by the expectation of the ark.

It may strike the reader as a little singular, that the place where
a stream of any size passed through banks that had an elevation of
some twenty feet, should be a matter of doubt with men who could
not now have been more than two hundred yards distant from the
precise spot.  It will be recollected, however, that the trees and
bushes here, as elsewhere, fairly overhung the water, making such
a fringe to the lake, as to conceal any little variations from its
general outline.

"I've not been down at this end of the lake these two summers,"
said Hurry, standing up in the canoe, the better to look about him.
"Ay, there's the rock, showing its chin above the water, and I
know that the river begins in its neighborhood."

The men now plied the paddles again, and they were presently within
a few yards of the rock, floating towards it, though their efforts
were suspended.  This rock was not large, being merely some five
or six feet high, only half of which elevation rose above the lake.
The incessant washing of the water for centuries had so rounded
its summit, that it resembled a large beehive in shape, its form
being more than usually regular and even.  Hurry remarked, as they
floated slowly past, that this rock was well known to all the Indians
in that part of the country, and that they were in the practice of
using it as a mark to designate the place of meeting, when separated
by their hunts and marches.

"And here is the river, Deerslayer," he continued, "though so shut
in by trees and bushes as to look more like an and-bush, than the
outlet of such a sheet as the Glimmerglass."

Hurry had not badly described the place, which did truly seem to be
a stream lying in ambush.  The high banks might have been a hundred
feet asunder; but, on the western side, a small bit of low land
extended so far forward as to diminish the breadth of the stream
to half that width.

As the bushes hung in the water beneath, and pines that had the
stature of church-steeples rose in tall columns above, all inclining
towards the light, until their branches intermingled, the eye, at
a little distance, could not easily detect any opening in the shore,
to mark the egress of the water.  In the forest above, no traces
of this outlet were to be seen from the lake, the whole presenting
the same connected and seemingly interminable carpet of leaves.
As the canoe slowly advanced, sucked in by the current, it entered
beneath an arch of trees, through which the light from the heavens
struggled by casual openings, faintly relieving the gloom beneath.

"This is a nat'ral and-bush," half whispered Hurry, as if he felt
that the place was devoted to secrecy and watchfulness; "depend on
it, old Tom has burrowed with the ark somewhere in this quarter.
We will drop down with the current a short distance, and ferret
him out."

"This seems no place for a vessel of any size," returned the other;
"it appears to me that we shall have hardly room enough for the
canoe."

Hurry laughed at the suggestion, and, as it soon appeared, with
reason; for the fringe of bushes immediately on the shore of the
lake was no sooner passed, than the adventurers found themselves
in a narrow stream, of a sufficient depth of limpid water, with a
strong current, and a canopy of leaves upheld by arches composed
of the limbs of hoary trees.  Bushes lined the shores, as usual,
but they left sufficient space between them to admit the passage
of anything that did not exceed twenty feet in width, and to allow
of a perspective ahead of eight or ten times that distance.

Neither of our two adventurers used his paddle, except to keep
the light bark in the centre of the current, but both watched each
turning of the stream, of which there were two or three within
the first hundred yards, with jealous vigilance.  Turn after turn,
however, was passed, and the canoe had dropped down with the current
some little distance, when Hurry caught a bush, and arrested its
movement so suddenly and silently as to denote some unusual motive
for the act.  Deerslayer laid his hand on the stock of his rifle
as soon as he noted this proceeding, but it was quite as much with
a hunter's habit as from any feeling of alarm.

"There the old fellow is!" whispered Hurry, pointing with a finger,
and laughing heartily, though he carefully avoided making a noise,
"ratting it away, just as I supposed; up to his knees in the mud
and water, looking to the traps and the bait.  But for the life
of me I can see nothing of the ark; though I'll bet every skin
I take this season, Jude isn't trusting her pretty little feet in
the neighborhood of that black mud.  The gal's more likely to be
braiding her hair by the side of some spring, where she can see
her own good looks, and collect scornful feelings ag'in us men."

"You over-judge young women- yes, you do, Hurry- who as often
bethink them of their failings as they do of their perfections.  I
dare to say this Judith, now, is no such admirer of herself, and
no such scorner of our sex as you seem to think; and that she
is quite as likely to be sarving her father in the house, wherever
that may be, as he is to be sarving her among the traps."

"It's a pleasure to hear truth from a man's tongue, if it be only
once in a girl's life," cried a pleasant, rich, and yet soft female
voice, so near the canoe as to make both the listeners start.  "As
for you, Master Hurry, fair words are so apt to choke you, that I
no longer expect to hear them from your mouth; the last you uttered
sticking in your throat, and coming near to death.  But I'm glad
to see you keep better society than formerly, and that they who
know how to esteem and treat women are not ashamed to journey in
your company."

As this was said, a singularly handsome and youthful female
face was thrust through an opening in the leaves, within reach of
Deerslayer's paddle.  Its owner smiled graciously on the young man;
and the frown that she cast on Hurry, though simulated and pettish,
had the effect to render her beauty more striking, by exhibiting the
play of an expressive but capricious countenance; one that seemed
to change from the soft to the severe, the mirthful to the reproving,
with facility and indifference.

A second look explained the nature of the surprise.  Unwittingly,
the men had dropped alongside of the ark, which had been purposely
concealed in bushes cut and arranged for the purpose; and Judith
Hutter had merely pushed aside the leaves that lay before a window,
in order to show her face, and speak to them.



Chapter IV.


    "And that timid fawn starts not with fear,
    When I steal to her secret bower;
    And that young May violet to me is dear,
    And I visit the silent streamlet near,
    To look on the lovely flower."

    Bryant, "An Indian Story," ii.11-15

The ark, as the floating habitation of the Hutters was generally
called, was a very simple contrivance.  A large flat, or scow,
composed the buoyant part of the vessel; and in its centre, occupying
the whole of its breadth, and about two thirds of its length, stood
a low fabric, resembling the castle in construction, though made
of materials so light as barely to be bullet-proof.  As the sides
of the scow were a little higher than usual, and the interior of
the cabin had no more elevation than was necessary for comfort,
this unusual addition had neither a very clumsy nor a very obtrusive
appearance.  It was, in short, little more than a modern canal-boat,
though more rudely constructed, of greater breadth than common, and
bearing about it the signs of the wilderness, in its bark-covered
posts and roof.  The scow, however, had been put together with some
skill, being comparatively light, for its strength, and sufficiently
manageable.  The cabin was divided into two apartments, one of which
served for a parlor, and the sleeping-room of the father, and the
other was appropriated to the uses of the daughters.  A very simple
arrangement sufficed for the kitchen, which was in one end of the
scow, and removed from the cabin, standing in the open air; the
ark being altogether a summer habitation.

The "and-bush," as Hurry in his ignorance of English termed it, is
quite as easily explained.  In many parts of the lake and river,
where the banks were steep and high, the smaller trees and larger
bushes, as has been already mentioned, fairly overhung the stream,
their branches not unfrequently dipping into the water.  In some
instances they grew out in nearly horizontal lines, for thirty or
forty feet.  The water being uniformly deepest near the shores,
where the banks were highest and the nearest to a perpendicular,
Hutter had found no difficulty in letting the ark drop under one
of these covers, where it had been anchored with a view to conceal
its position; security requiring some such precautions, in his
view of the case.  Once beneath the trees and bushes, a few stones
fastened to the ends of the branches had caused them to bend
sufficiently to dip into the river; and a few severed bushes,
properly disposed, did the rest.  The reader has seen that this
cover was so complete as to deceive two men accustomed to the woods,
and who were actually in search of those it concealed; a circumstance
that will be easily understood by those who are familiar with
the matted and wild luxuriance of a virgin American forest, more
especially in a rich soil.  The discovery of the ark produced very
different effects on our two adventurers.

As soon as the canoe could be got round to the proper opening, Hurry
leaped on board, and in a minute was closely engaged in a gay, and
a sort of recriminating discourse with Judith, apparently forgetful
of the existence of all the rest of the world.  Not so with Deerslayer.
He entered the ark with a slow, cautious step, examining every
arrangement of the cover with curious and scrutinizing eyes.  It
is true, he cast one admiring glance at Judith, which was extorted
by her brilliant and singular beauty; but even this could detain
him but a single instant from the indulgence of his interest in
Hutter's contrivances.  Step by step did he look into the construction
of the singular abode, investigate its fastenings and strength,
ascertain its means of defence, and make every inquiry that would
be likely to occur to one whose thoughts dwelt principally on such
expedients.  Nor was the cover neglected.  Of this he examined the
whole minutely, his commendation escaping him more than once in
audible comments.  Frontier usages admitting of this familiarity,
he passed through the rooms, as he had previously done at the 'Castle', and
opening a door issued into the end of the scow opposite to that
where he had left Hurry and Judith.  Here he found the other sister,
employed at some coarse needle-work, seated beneath the leafy canopy
of the cover.

As Deerslayer's examination was by this time ended, he dropped the
butt of his rifle, and, leaning on the barrel with both hands, he
turned towards the girl with an interest the singular beauty of
her sister had not awakened.  He had gathered from Hurry's remarks
that Hetty was considered to have less intellect than ordinarily
falls to the share of human beings, and his education among Indians
had taught him to treat those who were thus afflicted by Providence
with more than common tenderness.  Nor was there any thing in Hetty
Hutter's appearance, as so often happens, to weaken the interest
her situation excited.  An idiot she could not properly be termed,
her mind being just enough enfeebled to lose most of those traits
that are connected with the more artful qualities, and to retain
its ingenuousness and love of truth.  It had often been remarked of
this girl, by the few who had seen her, and who possessed sufficient
knowledge to discriminate, that her perception of the right seemed
almost intuitive, while her aversion to the wrong formed so distinctive
a feature of her mind, as to surround her with an atmosphere of
pure morality; peculiarities that are not infrequent with persons
who are termed feeble-minded; as if God had forbidden the evil spirits
to invade a precinct so defenceless, with the benign purpose of
extending a direct protection to those who had been left without the
usual aids of humanity.  Her person, too, was agreeable, having a
strong resemblance to that of her sister's, of which it was a subdued
and humble copy.  If it had none of the brilliancy of Judith's, the
calm, quiet, almost holy expression of her meek countenance seldom
failed to win on the observer, and few noted it long that did not
begin to feel a deep and lasting interest in the girl.  She had no
colour, in common, nor was her simple mind apt to present images
that caused her cheek to brighten, though she retained a modesty
so innate that it almost raised her to the unsuspecting purity of
a being superior to human infirmities.  Guileless, innocent, and
without distrust, equally by nature and from her mode of life,
providence had, nevertheless shielded her from harm, by a halo of
moral light, as it is said 'to temper the wind to the shorn lamb.'

"You are Hetty Hutter," said Deerslayer, in the way one puts a
question unconsciously to himself, assuming a kindness of tone and
manner that were singularly adapted to win the confidence of her
he addressed.  "Hurry Harry has told me of you, and I know you must
be the child?"

"Yes, I'm Hetty Hutter" returned the girl in a low, sweet voice,
which nature, aided by some education, had preserved from vulgarity
of tone and utterance-"I'm Hetty; Judith Hutter's sister; and Thomas
Hutter's youngest daughter."

"I know your history, then, for Hurry Harry talks considerable,
and he is free of speech when he can find other people's consarns
to dwell on.  You pass most of your life on the lake, Hetty."

"Certainly.  Mother is dead; father is gone a-trapping, and Judith
and I stay at home.  What's your name?"

"That's a question more easily asked than it is answered, young
woman, seeing that I'm so young, and yet have borne more names than
some of the greatest chiefs in all America."

"But you've got a name- you don't throw away one name, before you
come honestly by another?"

"I hope not, gal- I hope not.  My names have come nat'rally, and I
suppose the one I bear now will be of no great lasting, since the
Delawares seldom settle on a man's ra'al title, until such time as
he has an opportunity of showing his true natur', in the council,
or on the warpath; which has never behappened me; seeing firstly,
because I'm not born a red-skin and have no right to sit in their
councillings, and am much too humble to be called on for opinions
from the great of my own colour; and, secondly, because this is
the first war that has befallen in my time, and no inimy has yet
inroaded far enough into the colony, to be reached by an arm even
longer than mine."

"Tell me your names," added Hetty, looking up at him artlessly,
"and, maybe, I'll tell you your character."

"There is some truth in that, I'll not deny, though it often fails.
Men are deceived in other men's characters, and frequently give
'em names they by no means desarve.  You can see the truth of this
in the Mingo names, which, in their own tongue, signify the same
things as the Delaware names,- at least, so they tell me, for I know
little of that tribe, unless it be by report,- and no one can say
they are as honest or as upright a nation.  I put no great dependence,
therefore, on names."

"Tell me all your names," repeated the girl, earnestly, for her
mind was too simple to separate things from professions, and she
did attach importance to a name; "I want to know what to think of
you."

"Well, sartain; I've no objection, and you shall hear them all.
In the first place, then, I'm Christian, and white-born, like
yourself, and my parents had a name that came down from father to
son, as is a part of their gifts.  My father was called Bumppo; and
I was named after him, of course, the given name being Nathaniel,
or Natty, as most people saw fit to tarm it."

"Yes, yes - Natty - and Hetty" interrupted the girl quickly, and
looking up from her work again, with a smile: "you are Natty, and
I'm Hetty-though you are Bumppo, and I'm Hutter.  Bumppo isn't
as pretty as Hutter, is it?"

"Why, that's as people fancy.  Bumppo has no lofty sound, I admit;
and yet men have bumped through the world with it.  I did not go
by this name, howsoever, very long; for the Delawares soon found
out, or thought they found out, that I was not given to lying, and
they called me, firstly, 'Straight-tongue.'"

"That's a good name," interrupted Hetty, earnestly, and in a
positive manner; "don't tell me there's no virtue in names!"

"I do not say that, for perhaps I desarved to be so called, lies
being no favorites with me, as they are with some.  After a while
they found out I was quick of foot, and then they called me 'The
Pigeon'; which, you know, has a swift wing, and flies in a straight
line."

"That was a pretty name!" exclaimed Hetty; "pigeons are pretty
birds!"

"Most things that God created are pretty in their way, my good gal,
though they get to be deformed by mankind, so as to change their
natur's, as well as their appearance.  From carrying messages, and
striking blind trails, I got at last to following the hunters, when
it was thought I was quicker and surer at finding the game than
most lads, and then they called me the 'Lap-ear'; as, they said,
I partook of the sagacity of the hound."

"That's not so pretty," answered Hetty; "I hope you didn't keep
that name long."

"Not after I was rich enough to buy a rifle," returned the other,
betraying a little pride through his usually quiet and subdued
manner; "then it was seen I could keep a wigwam in ven'son; and
in time I got the name of 'Deerslayer,' which is that I now bear;
homely as some will think it, who set more value on the scalp of
a fellow-mortal than on the horns of a buck"

"Well, Deerslayer, I'm not one of them," answered Hetty, simply;
"Judith likes soldiers, and flary coats, and fine feathers; but
they're all naught to me.  She says the officers are great, and gay,
and of soft speech; but they make me shudder, for their business
is to kill their fellow-creatures.  I like your calling better;
and your last name is a very good one-- better than Natty Bumppo."

"This is nat'ral in one of your turn of mind, Hetty, and much as I
should have expected.  They tell me your sister is handsome--oncommon,
for a mortal; and beauty is apt to seek admiration."

"Did you never see Judith?" demanded the girl, with quick earnestness;
"if you never have, go at once and look at her.  Even Hurry Harry
isn't more pleasant to look at though she is a woman, and he is
a man."

Deerslayer regarded the girl for a moment with concern.  Her
pale-face had flushed a little, and her eye, usually so mild and
serene, brightened as she spoke, in the way to betray the inward
impulses.

"Ay, Hurry Harry,"  he muttered to himself, as he walked through
the cabin towards the other end of the boat; "this comes of good
looks, if a light tongue has had no consarn in it.  It's easy to
see which way that poor creatur's feelin's are leanin', whatever
may be the case with your Jude's."

But an interruption was put to the gallantry of Hurry, the coquetry
of his intros, the thoughts of Deerslayer, and the gentle feelings
of Hetty, by the sudden appearance of the canoe of the ark's owner,
in the narrow opening among the bushes that served as a sort of
moat to his position.  It would seem that Hutter, or Floating Tom,
as he was familiarly called by all the hunters who knew his habits,
recognized the canoe of Hurry, for he expressed no surprise at
finding him in the scow.  On the contrary, his reception was such
as to denote not only gratification, but a pleasure, mingled with
a little disappointment at his not having made his appearance some
days sooner.

"I looked for you last week," he said, in a half-grumbling,
half-welcoming manner; "and was disappointed uncommonly that you
didn't arrive.  There came a runner through, to warn all the trappers
and hunters that the colony and the Canadas were again in trouble;
and I felt lonesome, up in these mountains, with three scalps to
see to, and only one pair of hands to protect them."

"That's reasonable," returned March; "and 't was feeling like a
parent.  No doubt, if I had two such darters as Judith and Hetty,
my exper'ence would tell the same story, though in gin'ral I am
just as well satisfied with having the nearest neighbor fifty miles
off, as when he is within call."

"Notwithstanding, you didn't choose to come into the wilderness
alone, now you knew that the Canada savages are likely to be
stirring," returned Hutter, giving a sort of distrustful, and at
the same time inquiring glance at Deerslayer.

"Why should I?  They say a bad companion, on a journey, helps to
shorten the path; and this young man I account to be a reasonably
good one.  This is Deerslayer, old Tom, a noted hunter among the
Delawares, and Christian-born, and Christian-edicated, too, like
you and me.  The lad is not parfect, perhaps, but there's worse
men in the country that he came from, and it's likely he'll find
some that's no better, in this part of the world.  Should we have
occasion to defend our traps, and the territory, he'll be useful
in feeding us all; for he's a reg'lar dealer in ven'son."

"Young man, you are welcome," growled Tom, thrusting a hard, bony
hand towards the youth, as a pledge of his sincerity; "in such
times, a white face is a friend's, and I count on you as a support.
Children sometimes make a stout heart feeble, and these two daughters
of mine give me more concern than all my traps, and skins, and
rights in the country."

"That's nat'ral!" cried Hurry.  "Yes, Deerslayer, you and I don't
know it yet by experience; but, on the whole, I consider that as
nat'ral.  If we had darters, it's more than probable we should
have some such feelin's; and I honor the man that owns 'em.  As
for Judith, old man, I enlist, at once, as her soldier, and here
is Deerslayer to help you to take care of Hetty."

"Many thanks to you, Master March," returned the beauty, in a full,
rich voice, and with an accuracy of intonation and utterance that
she shared in common with her sister, and which showed that she
had been better taught than her father's life and appearance would
give reason to expect.  "Many thanks to you; but Judith Hutter
has the spirit and the experience that will make her depend more
on herself than on good-looking rovers like you.  Should there be
need to face the savages, do you land with my father, instead of
burrowing in the huts, under the show of defending us females and-"

"Girl-- girl,"  interrupted the father, "quiet that glib tongue
of thine, and hear the truth.  There are savages on the lake shore
already, and no man can say how near to us they may be at this very
moment, or when we may hear more from them!"

"If this be true, Master Hutter," said Hurry, whose change of
countenance denoted how serious he deemed the information, though
it did not denote any unmanly alarm, "if this be true, your ark is
in a most misfortunate position, for, though the cover did deceive
Deerslayer and myself, it would hardly be overlooked by a full-blooded
Injin, who was out seriously in s'arch of scalps!"

"I think as you do, Hurry, and wish, with all my heart, we lay
anywhere else, at this moment, than in this narrow, crooked stream,
which has many advantages to hide in, but which is almost fatal to
them that are discovered.  The savages are near us, moreover, and
the difficulty is, to get out of the river without being shot down
like deer standing at a lick!"

"Are you sartain, Master Hutter, that the red-skins you dread are
ra'al Canadas?" asked Deerslayer, in a modest but earnest manner.
"Have you seen any, and can you describe their paint?"

"I have fallen in with the signs of their being in the neighborhood,
but have seen none of 'em.  I was down stream a mile or so, looking
to my traps, when I struck a fresh trail, crossing the corner of a
swamp, and moving northward.  The man had not passed an hour; and
I know'd it for an Indian footstep, by the size of the foot, and
the intoe, even before I found a worn moccasin, which its owner
had dropped as useless.  For that matter, I found the spot where
he halted to make a new one, which was only a few yards from the
place where he had dropped the old one."

"That doesn't look much like a red-skin on the war path!" returned
the other, shaking his head.  "An exper'enced warrior, at least,
would have burned, or buried, or sunk in the river such signs of
his passage; and your trail is, quite likely, a peaceable trail.
But the moccasin may greatly relieve my mind, if you bethought you
of bringing it off.  I've come here to meet a young chief myself;
and his course would be much in the direction you've mentioned.
The trail may have been his'n."

"Hurry Harry, you're well acquainted with this young man, I hope,
who has meetings with savages in a part of the country where he
has never been before?" demanded Hutter, in a tone and in a manner
that sufficiently indicated the motive of the question; these rude
beings seldom hesitating, on the score of delicacy, to betray their
feelings.  "Treachery is an Indian virtue; and the whites, that
live much in their tribes, soon catch their ways and practices."

"True- true as the Gospel, old Tom; but not personable to Deerslayer,
who's a young man of truth, if he has no other ricommend.  I'll
answer for his honesty, whatever I may do for his valor in battle."

"I should like to know his errand in this strange quarter of the
country."

"That is soon told, Master Hutter," said the young man, with the
composure of one who kept a clean conscience.  "I think, moreover,
you've a right to ask it.  The father of two such darters,
who occupies a lake, after your fashion, has just the same right
to inquire into a stranger's business in his neighborhood, as the
colony would have to demand the reason why the Frenchers put more
rijiments than common along the lines.  No, no, I'll not deny your
right to know why a stranger comes into your habitation or country,
in times as serious as these."

"If such is your way of thinking, friend, let me hear your story
without more words."

"'T is soon told, as I said afore; and shall be honestly told.  I'm
 a young man, and, as yet, have never been on a war-path; but
no sooner did the news come among the Delawares, that wampum and
a hatchet were about to be sent in to the tribe, than they wished
me to go out among the people of my own color, and get the exact
state of things for 'em.  This I did, and, after delivering my
talk to the chiefs, on my return, I met an officer of the crown on
the Schoharie, who had messages to send to some of the fri'ndly
tribes that live farther west.  This was thought a good occasion
for Chingachgook, a young chief who has never struck a foe, and
myself; to go on our first war path in company, and an app'intment
was made for us, by an old Delaware, to meet at the rock near the
foot of this lake.  I'll not deny that Chingachgook has another
object in view, but it has no consarn with any here, and is his
secret and not mine; therefore I'll say no more about it."

"'Tis something about a young woman," interrupted Judith hastily,
then laughing at her own impetuosity, and even having the grace
to colour a little, at the manner in which she had betrayed her
readiness to impute such a motive.  "If 'tis neither war, nor a
hunt, it must be love."

"Ay, it comes easy for the young and handsome, who hear so much
of them feelin's, to suppose that they lie at the bottom of most
proceedin's; but, on that head, I say nothin'.  Chingachgook is to
meet me at the rock, an hour afore sunset tomorrow evening, after
which we shall go our way together, molesting none but the king's
inimies, who are lawfully our own.  Knowing Hurry of old, who
once trapped in our hunting grounds, and falling in with him on the
Schoharie, just as he was on the p'int of starting for his summer
ha'nts, we agreed to journey in company; not so much from fear of
the Mingos, as from good fellowship, and, as he says, to shorten
a long road."

"And you think the trail I saw may have been that of your friend,
ahead of his time?" said Hutter.

"That's my idee, which may be wrong, but which may be right.  If I
saw the moccasin, howsever, I could tell, in a minute, whether it
is made in the Delaware fashion, or not."

"Here it is, then," said the quick-witted Judith, who had already
gone to the canoe in quest of it.  "Tell us what it says; friend
or enemy.  You look honest, and I believe all you say, whatever
father may think."

"That's the way with you, Jude; forever finding out friends, where
I distrust foes," grumbled Tom: "but, speak out, young man, and
tell us what you think of the moccasin."

"That's not Delaware made," returned Deerslayer, examining the worn
and rejected covering for the foot with a cautious eye.  "I'm too
young on a war-path to be positive, but I should say that moccasin
has a northern look, and comes from beyond the Great Lakes."

"If such is the case, we ought not to lie here a minute longer
than is necessary," said Hutter, glancing through the leaves of
his cover, as if he already distrusted the presence of an enemy on
the opposite shore of the narrow and sinuous stream.  "It wants but
an hour or so of night, and to move in the dark will be impossible,
without making a noise that would betray us.  Did you hear the echo
of a piece in the mountains, half-an-hour since?"

"Yes, old man, and heard the piece itself," answered Hurry, who now
felt the indiscretion of which he had been guilty, "for the last
was fired from my own shoulder."

"I feared it came from the French Indians; still it may put them
on the look-out, and be a means of discovering us.  You did wrong
to fire in war-time, unless there was good occasion.

"So I begin to think myself, Uncle Tom; and yet, if a man can't
trust himself to let off his rifle in a wilderness that is a thousand
miles square, lest some inimy should hear it, where's the use in
carrying one?"

Hutter now held a long consultation with his two guests, in which
the parties came to a true understanding of their situation.  He
explained the difficulty that would exist in attempting to get
the ark out of so swift and narrow a stream, in the dark, without
making a noise that could not fail to attract Indian ears.  Any
strollers in their vicinity would keep near the river or the lake;
but the former had swampy shores in many places, and was both so
crooked and so fringed with bushes, that it was quite possible to
move by daylight without incurring much danger of being seen.  More
was to be apprehended, perhaps, from the ear than from the eye,
especially as long as they were in the short, straitened, and
canopied reaches of the stream.

"I never drop down into this cover, which is handy to my traps,
and safer than the lake from curious eyes, without providing the
means of getting out ag'in," continued this singular being; "and
that is easier done by a pull than a push.  My anchor is now lying
above the suction, in the open lake; and here is a line, you see,
to haul us up to it.  Without some such help, a single pair of
bands would make heavy work in forcing a scow like this up stream.
I have a sort of a crab, too, that lightens the pull, on occasion.
Jude can use the oar astern as well as myself; and when we fear no
enemy, to get out of the river gives us but little trouble."

"What should we gain, Master Hutter, by changing the position?"
asked Deerslayer, with a good deal of earnestness; "this is a safe
cover, and a stout defence might be made from the inside of this
cabin.  I've never fou't unless in the way of tradition; but it
seems to me we might beat off twenty Mingos, with palisades like
them afore us."

"Ay, ay; you 've never fought except in traditions, that's plain
enough, young man!  Did you ever see as broad a sheet of water as
this above us, before you came in upon it with Hurry?"

"I can't say that I ever did," Deerslayer answered, modestly.  "Youth
is the time to l'arn; and I'm far from wishing to raise my voice
in counsel, afore it is justified by exper'ence."

"Well, then, I'll teach you the disadvantage of fighting in this
position, and the advantage of taking to the open lake.  Here,
you may see, the savages will know where to aim every shot; and it
would be too much to hope that some would not find their way through
the crevices of the logs.  Now, on the other hand, we should have
nothing but a forest to aim at.  Then we are not safe from fire,
here, the bark of this roof being little better than so much
kindling-wood.  The castle, too, might be entered and ransacked in
my absence, and all my possessions overrun and destroyed.  Once in
the lake, we can be attacked only in boats or on rafts- shall have
a fair chance with the enemy-and can protect the castle with the
ark.  Do you understand this reasoning, youngster?"

"It sounds well- yes, it has a rational sound; and I'll not gainsay
it."

"Well, old Tom," cried Hurry, "If we are to move, the sooner we
make a beginning, the sooner we shall know whether we are to have
our scalps for night-caps, or not."

As this proposition was self-evident, no one denied its justice.
The three men, after a short preliminary explanation, now set
about their preparations to move the ark in earnest.  The slight
fastenings were quickly loosened; and, by hauling on the line, the
heavy craft slowly emerged from the cover.  It was no sooner free
from the incumbrance of the branches, than it swung into the stream,
sheering quite close to the western shore, by the force of the
current.  Not a soul on board heard the rustling of the branches,
as the cabin came against the bushes and trees of the western bank,
without a feeling of uneasiness; for no one knew at what moment, or
in what place, a secret and murderous enemy might unmask himself.
Perhaps the gloomy light that still struggled through the impending
canopy of leaves, or found its way through the narrow, ribbon-like
opening, which seemed to mark, in the air above, the course of
the river that flowed beneath, aided in augmenting the appearance
of the danger; for it was little more than sufficient to render
objects visible, without giving up all their outlines at a glance.
Although the sun had not absolutely set, it had withdrawn its direct
rays from the valley; and the hues of evening were beginning to
gather around objects that stood uncovered, rendering those within
the shadows of the woods still more sombre and gloomy.

No interruption followed the movement, however, and, as the men
continued to haul on the line, the ark passed steadily ahead, the
great breadth of the scow preventing its sinking into the water,
and from offering much resistance to the progress of the swift
element beneath its bottom.  Hutter, too, had adopted a precaution
suggested by experience, which might have done credit to a seaman,
and which completely prevented any of the annoyances and obstacles
which otherwise would have attended the short turns of the river.
As the ark descended, heavy stones, attached to the line, were
dropped in the centre of the stream, forming local anchors, each
of which was kept from dragging by the assistance of those above
it, until the uppermost of all was reached, which got its "backing"
from the anchor, or grapnel, that lay well out in the lake.  In
consequence of this expedient, the ark floated clear of the
incumbrances of the shore, against which it would otherwise have
been unavoidably hauled at every turn, producing embarrassments
that Hutter, single-handed, would have found it very difficult to
overcome.  Favored by this foresight, and stimulated by the apprehension
of discovery, Floating Tom and his two athletic companions hauled
the ark ahead with quite as much rapidity as comported with the
strength of the line.  At every turn in the stream, a stone was
raised from the bottom, when the direction of the scow changed to
one that pointed towards the stone that lay above.  In this manner,
with the channel buoyed out for him, as a sailor might term it,
did Hutter move forward, occasionally urging his friends, in a low
and guarded voice, to increase their exertions, and then, as occasions
offered, warning them against efforts that might, at particular
moments, endanger all by too much zeal.  In spite of their long
familiarity with the woods, the gloomy character of the shaded river
added to the uneasiness that each felt; and when the ark reached
the first bend in the Susquehannah, and the eye caught a glimpse
of the broader expanse of the lake, all felt a relief, that perhaps
none would have been willing to confess.  Here the last stone
was raised from the bottom, and the line led directly towards the
grapnel, which, as Hutter had explained, was dropped above the
suction of the current.

"Thank God!" ejaculated Hurry, "there is daylight, and we shall
soon have a chance of seeing our inimies, if we are to feel 'em."

"That is more than you or any man can say," growled Hutter.
"There is no spot so likely to harbor a party as the shore around
the outlet, and the moment we clear these trees and get into
open water, will be the most trying time, since it will leave the
enemy a cover, while it puts us out of one.  Judith, girl, do you
and Hetty leave the oar to take care of itself; and go within the
cabin; and be mindful not to show your faces at a window; for they
who will look at them won't stop to praise their beauty.  And now,
Hurry, we 'll step into this outer room ourselves, and haul through
the door, where we shall all be safe, from a surprise, at least.
Friend Deerslayer, as the current is lighter, and the line has all
the strain on it that is prudent, do you keep moving from window
to window, taking care not to let your head be seen, if you set
any value on life.  No one knows when or where
