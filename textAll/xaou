Bakhshish" must bring water into the
mouths of all the bath-men in the coffee-house assembly.

[FN#214] i.e. the treasurer did not, as is the custom of such
gentry, demand and receive a large "Bakhshish" on the occasion. 

[FN#215] A fair specimen of clever Fellah chaff.

[FN#216] In the first room of the Hammam, called the Maslakh or
stripping-place, the keeper sits by a large chest in which he
deposits the purses and valuables of his customers and also makes
it the caisse for the pay.  Something of the kind is now done in
the absurdly called "Turkish Baths" of London.

[FN#217] This is the rule in Egypt and Syria and a clout hung
over the door shows that women are bathing.  I have heard, but
only heard, that in times and places when eunuchs went in with
the women youths managed by long practice to retract the
testicles so as to pass for castratos.  It is hard to say what
perseverance may not effect in this line; witness Orsini and his
abnormal development of hearing, by exercising muscles which are
usually left idle.

[FN#218] This reference to Allah shows that Abu Sir did not
believe his dyer-friend.

[FN#219] Arab. "Dawa" (lit. remedy, medicine) the vulgar term:
see vol. iv. 256: also called Rasmah, Nurah and many other names.

[FN#220] Arab. "Ma Kahara-ni" = or none hath overcome me. 

[FN#221] Bresl. Edit. "The King of Isbaniya." For the "Ishban"
(Spaniards) an ancient people descended from Japhet son of Noah
and who now are no more, see Al-Mas'udi (Fr. Transl. I. 361). The
"Herodotus of the Arabs" recognises only the "Jalalikah" or
Gallicians, thus bearing witness to the antiquity and importance
of the Gallego race.

[FN#222] Arab. "Sha'r," properly, hair of body, pile, especially
the pecten. See Bruckhardt (Prov. No. 202), "grieving for lack of
a cow she made a whip of her bush," said of those who console
themselves by building Castles in Spain. The "parts below the
waist" is the decent Turkish term for the privities.

[FN#223] The drowning is a martyr's death, the burning is a
foretaste of Hell-fire.

[FN#224] Meaning that if the trick had been discovered the
Captain would have taken the barber's place. We have seen (vol.
i. 63) the Prime Minister superintending the royal kitchen and
here the Admiral fishes for the King's table. It is even more
naive than the Court of Alcinous.

[FN#225] Bresl. Edit. xi. 32: i.e. save me from disgrace.

[FN#226] Arab. "Khinsir" or "Khinsar," the little finger or the
middle finger. In Arabic each has its own name or names which is
also that of the corresponding toe, e.g. Ibham (thumb); Sabbabah,
Musabbah or Da'aah (fore-finger); Wasta (medius); Binsir
(annularis ring-finger) and Khinsar (minimus). There are also
names for the several spaces between the fingers. See the English
Arabic Dictionary (London, Kegan Paul an Co., 1881) by the Revd.
Dr. Badger, a work of immense labour and research but which I
fear has been so the learned author a labour of love not of
profit.

[FN#227] Meaning of course that the King signed towards the sack
in which he supposed the victim to be, but the ring fell off
before it could take effect. The Eastern story-teller often
balances his multiplicity of words and needless details by a
conciseness and an elliptical style which make his meaning a
matter of divination.

[FN#228] See vol. v. 111.

[FN#229] This couplet was quoted to me by my friend the Rev. Dr.
Badger when he heard that I was translating "The Nights":
needless to say that it is utterly inappropriate.

[FN#230] For a similar figure see vol i. 25.

[FN#231] Arab. "Hanzal": see vol. v. 19.

[FN#232]  The tale begins upon the model of "Judar and his
Brethren," vi. 213.  Its hero's full name is Abdu'llahi=Slave of
Allah, which vulgar Egyptians pronounce Abdallah and purer
speakers, Badawin and others, Abdullah: either form is therefore
admissible.  It is more common among Moslems but not unknown to
Christians especially Syrians who borrow it from the Syriac
Alloh.  Mohammed is said to have said, "The names most approved
by Allah are Abdu'llah, Abd al-Rahman (Slave of the
Compassionate) and such like" (Pilgrimage i. 20).

[FN#233]  Arab. "Sirah" here probably used of the Nile-sprat
(Clupea Sprattus Linn.) or Sardine of which Forsk says, "Sardinn
in Al-Yaman is applied to a Red Sea fish of the same name." 
Hasselquist the Swede notes that Egyptians stuff the Sardine with
marjoram and eat it fried even when half putrid.

[FN#234]  i.e. by declaring in the Koran (lxvii. 14; lxxiv. 39;
lxxviii. 69; lxxxviii. 17), that each creature hath its appointed
term and lot; especially "Thinketh man that he shall be left
uncared for?" (xl. 36).

[FN#235]  Arab. "Nusf," see vol. ii. 37.

[FN#236]  Arab. "Allah Karim" (which Turks pronounce Kyerim) a
consecrated formula used especially when a man would show himself
resigned to "small mercies."  The fisherman's wife was evidently
pious as she was poor; and the description of the pauper
household is simple and effective.

[FN#237]  This is repeated in the Mac. Edit. pp. 496-97; an
instance amongst many of most careless editing.

[FN#238]  Arab. "Ala mahlak" (vulg.), a popular phrase, often
corresponding with our "Take it coolly."

[FN#239]  For "He did not keep him waiting, as he did the rest of
the folk."  Lane prefers "nor neglected him as men generally
would have done."  But we are told supra that the baker "paid no
heed to the folk by reason of the dense crowd."

[FN#240]  Arab. "Ruh!" the most abrupt form, whose sound is
coarse and offensive as the Turkish yell, "Gyel!"=come here.

[FN#241]  Bresl. Edit. xi. 50-51.

[FN#242]  Arab. "Adami"=an Adamite, one descended from the
mythical and typical Adam for whom see Philo Judaeus.  We are
told in one place a few lines further on that the merman is of
humankind; and in another that he is a kind of fish (Night
dccccxlv).  This belief in mermen, possible originating with the
caricatures of the human face in the intelligent seal and stupid
manatee, is universal.  Al-Kazwini declares that a waterman with
a tail was dried and exhibited, and that in Syria one of them was
married to a woman and had by her a son "who understood the
languages of both his parents."  The fable was refined to perfect
beauty by the Greeks: the mer-folk of the Arabs, Hindus and
Northerners (Scandinavians, etc) are mere grotesques with green
hair, etc.  Art in its highest expression never left the shores
of the Mediterranean, and there is no sign that it ever will.

[FN#243]  Here Lane translates "Wajh" lit. "the desire of seeing
the face of God," and explains in a note that a "Muslim holds
this to be the greatest happiness that can be enjoyed in
Paradise."  But I have noted that the tenet of seeing the
countenance of the Creator, except by the eyes of spirit, is a
much disputed point amongst Moslems.

[FN#244]  Artful enough is this contrast between the squalid
condition of the starving fisherman and the gorgeous belongings
of the Merman.

[FN#245]  Lit. "Verily he laughed at me so that I set him free."
This is a fair specimen of obscure conciseness.

[FN#246]  Arab. "Mishannah," which Lane and Payne translate
basket: I have always heard it used of an old gunny-bag or bag of
plaited palm-leaves.

[FN#247]  Arab. "Kaff Shurayk" applied to a single bun.  The
Shurayk is a bun, an oblong cake about the size of a man's hand
(hence the term "Kaff"=palm) with two long cuts and sundry
oblique crosscuts, made of leavened dough, glazed with egg and
Samn (clarified butter) and flavoured with spices (cinnamon,
curcuma, artemisia and prunes mahalab) and with aromatic seeds,
(Rihat al-'ajin) of which Lane (iii. 641) specifies aniseed,
nigella, absinthium, (Artemisia arborescens) and Kafurah (A.
camphorata Monspeliensis) etc.  The Shurayk is given to the poor
when visiting the tombs and on certain fetes.

[FN#248]  "Mother of Prosperities."

[FN#249]  Tribes of pre-historic Arabs who were sent to Hell for
bad behaviour to Prophets Salih and Hud.  See vol. iii. 294.

[FN#250]  "Too much for him to come by lawfully."

[FN#251]  To protect it.  The Arab. is "Jah"=high station,
dignity.

[FN#252]  The European reader, especially feminine, will think
this a hard fate for the pious first wife but the idea would not
occur to the Moslem mind.  After bearing ten children a woman
becomes "Umm al-banati w'al-banin"=a mother of daughters and
sons, and should hold herself unfit for love-disport.  The seven
ages of womankind are thus described by the Arabs and I translate
the lines after a well-known (Irish) model:--

          From ten years to twenty--
          Of beauty there's plenty.
          From twenty to thirty--
          Fat, fair and alert t'ye.
          From thirty to forty--
          Lads and lasses she bore t'ye.
          From forty to fifty--
          An old'un and shifty.
          From fifty to sixty--
          A sorrow that sticks t'ye.
          From sixty to seventy--
          A curse of God sent t'ye.

For these and other sentiments upon the subject of women and
marriage see Pilgrimage ii. 285-87.

[FN#253]  Abdullah, as has been said, means "servant or rather
slave of Allah."

[FN#254]  Again the "Come to my arms, my slight acquaintance," of
the Anti-Jacobin.

[FN#255]  Arab. "Nukl," e.g. the quatre mendicants as opposed to
"Fakihah"=fresh fruit.  The Persians, a people who delight in
gross practical jokes, get the confectioner to coat with sugar
the droppings of sheep and goats and hand them to the bulk of the
party.  This pleasant confection is called "Nukl-i-peshkil"--
dung-dragees.

[FN#256]  The older name of Madinat al-Nabi, the city of the
Prophet; vulg. called Al-Medinah per excellentiam.  See vol. iv.
114.  In the Mac. and Bul. texts we have "Tayyibah"=the goodly,
one of the many titles of that Holy City: see Pilgrimage ii. 119.

[FN#257]  Not "visiting the tomb of," etc. but visiting the
Prophet himself, who is said to have declared that "Ziyarah"
(visitation) of his tomb was in religion the equivalent of a
personal call upon himself.

[FN#258]  Arab. "Nafakah"; for its conditions see Pigrimage iii.
224. I have again and again insisted upon the Anglo-Indian
Government enforcing the regulations of the Faith upon pauper
Hindi pilgrims who go to the Moslem Holy Land as beggars and die
of hunger in the streets. To an "Empire of Opinion" this is an
unmitigated evil (Pilgrimage iii. 256); and now, after some
thirty-four years, there are signs that the suggestions of common
sense are to be adopted.  England has heard of the extraordinary
recklessness and inconsequence of the British-Indian "fellow-
subject."

[FN#259]  The Ka'abah of Meccah.

[FN#260]  When Moslems apply "Nabi!" to Mohammed it is in the
peculiar sense of "prophet" ({Greek})=one who speaks before the
people, not one who predicts, as such foresight was adjured by
the Apostle. Dr. A. Neubauer (The Athenaeum No. 3031) finds the
root of "Nabi!" in the Assyrian Nabu and Heb. Noob (occurring in
Exod. vii. 1. "Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet." i.e.
orator, speaker before the people), and holds it to be a
Canaanite term which supplanted "Roeh" (the Seer) e.g. 1 Samuel
ix. 9.  The learned Hebraist traces the cult of Nebo, a secondary
deity in Assyria to Palestine and Ph nicia, Palmyra, Edessa (in
the Nebok of Abgar) and Hierapolis in Syria or Mabug (Nabog?).

[FN#261]  I cannot find "Dandan" even in Lib. Quintus de
Aquaticis Animalibus of the learned Sam. Bochart's "Hierozoicon"
(London, 1663) and must conjecture that as "Dandan" in Persian
means a tooth (vol. ii. 83) the writer applied it to a sun-fish
or some such well-fanged monster of the deep.

[FN#262] A favourite proverb with the Fellah, when he alludes to
the Pasha and to himself.

[FN#263]  An euphemistic answer, unbernfen as the Germans say.

[FN#264]  It is a temptation to derive this word from b uf a
l'eau, but I fear that the theory will not hold water.  The
"buffaloes" of Alexandria laughted it to scorn.

[FN#265]  Here the writer's zoological knowledge is at fault. 
Animals, which never or very rarely see man, have no fear of him
whatever.  This is well-known to those who visit the Gull-fairs
at Ascension Island, Santos and many other isolated rocks; the
hen birds will peck at the intruder's ankles but they do not rise
from off their eggs.  For details concerning the "Gull-fair" of
the Summer Islands consult p. 4 "The History of the Bermudas,"
edited by Sir J. H. Lefroy for the Hakluyt Society, 1882.  I have
seen birds on Fernando Po peak quietly await a second shot; and
herds of antelopes, the most timed of animals, in the plains of
Somali-land only stared but were not startled by the report of
the gun.  But Arabs are not the only moralists who write
zoological nonsense: witness the notable verse,

          "Birds in their little nests agree,"

when the feathered tribes are the most pugnacious of breathing
beings.

[FN#266]  Lane finds these details "silly and tiresome or
otherwise objectionable," and omits them.

[FN#267]  Meaning, "Thou hast as yet seen little or nothing."  In
most Eastern tongues a question often expresses an emphatic
assertion. See vol. i. 37.

[FN#268]  Easterns wear as a rule little clothing but it suffices
for the essential purposes of decency and travellers will live
amongst them for years without once seeing an accidental
"exposure of the person." In some cases, as with the Nubian
thong-apron, this demand of modesty requires not a little
practice of the muscles; and we all know the difference in a
Scotch kilt worn by a Highlander and a cockney sportsman.

[FN#269]  Arab. "Shiraj"=oil extracted from rape seed but
especially from sesame.  The Persians pronounce it "Siraj"
(apparently unaware that it is their own word "Shirah"=juice in
Arabic garb) and have coined a participle "Musayrij" e.g., Bu-i-
musayrij, taint of sesame-oil applied especially to the Jews who
very wisely prefer, in Persia and elsewhere, oil which is
wholesome to butter which is not.  The Moslems, however, declare
that its immoderate use in cooking taints the exudations of the
skin.

[FN#270] Arab. "Nakkarun" probably congeners of the redoubtable
"Dandan."

[FN#271]  Bresl. Edit. xi. 78.  The Mac. says "They are all fish"
(Kullu-hum) and the Bul. "Their food (aklu-hum) is fish."

[FN#272]  Arab. "Az'ar," usually=having thin hair.  The general
term for tailless is "abtar."  See Koran cviii. 3, when it means
childless.

[FN#273]  A common formula of politeness.

[FN#274]  Bresl. Edit. xi. 82; meaning, "You will probably keep
it for yourself."  Abdullah of the Sea is perfectly logical; but
grief is not. We weep over the deaths of friends mostly for our
own sake: theoretically we should rejoice that they are at rest;
but practically we are afflicted by the thought that we shall
never again see their pleasant faces.

[FN#275]  i.e. about rejoicing over the newborns and mourning
over the dead.

[FN#276] i.e. Ishak of Mosul, for whom see vol. iv. 119. The
Bresl. Edit. has Fazil for Fazl.

[FN#277] Abu Dalaf al-Ijili, a well-known soldier equally famed
for liberality and culture.

[FN#278] Arab. "Takhmish," alluding to the familiar practice of
tearing face and hair in grief for a loss, a death, etc.

[FN#279] i.e. When he is in the very prime of life and able to
administer fiers coups de canif.

          "For ladies e'en of most uneasy virtue
          Prefer a spouse whose age is short of thirty."
                                                  Don Juan 1. 62.

[FN#280] Arab. "Lazuward": see vol. iii. 33.

[FN#281] Arab. "Sidillah." The Bresl. Edit. (v. 99), has, "a
couch of ivory and ebony, whereon was that which befitted it of
mattresses and cushions * * * * and on it five damsels."

[FN#282] i.e. As she untunes the lute by "pinching" the strings
over-excitedly with her right, her other hand retunes it by
turning the pegs.

[FN#283] i.e. The slim cupbearer (Zephyr) and fair-faced girl
(Moon) handed round the bubbling bowl (star).

[FN#284] Arab. "Al-Sath" whence the Span. Azotea. The lines that
follow are from the Bresl. Edit. v. 110.

[FN#285] This "'Ar'ar" is probably the Callitris quadrivalvis
whose resin ("Sandarac") is imported as varnish from African
Mogador to England. Also called the Thuja, it is of cypress
shape, slow growing and finely veined in the lower part of the
base. Most travellers are agreed that it is the Citrus-tree of
Roman Mauritania, concerning which Pliny (xiii. 29) gives curious
details, a single table costing from a million sesterces
(Stearling900) to 1,400,000.  For other details see p. 95,
"Morocco and the Moors," by my late friend Dr. Leared (London:
Sampson Low, 1876).

[FN#286] i.e. Kings might sigh for her in vain.

[FN#287] These lines are in vol. viii. 279. I quote Mr. Payne.

[FN#288] A most unsavoury comparison to a Persian who always
connects camphor with the idea of a corpse.

[FN#289] Arab. "Ila ma shaa' llah" i.e. as long as you like.

[FN#290] i.e. of gramarye.

[FN#291] Arab. "Ta'wiz"=the Arab Tilasm, our Talisman, a charm,
an amulet; and in India mostly a magic square. The subject is
complicated and occupies in Herklots some sixty pages, 222-284.

[FN#292] The Bul. and Mac. Edits. give the Princess's malady, in
error, as Daa al-Suda' (megrims), instead of Daa al-Sar'
(epilepsy) as in the Bresl. Edit. The latter would mean that she
is possessed by a demon, again the old Scriptural fancy (see vol.
v. 28). The subject is highly fitted for romance but not for a
"serious" book which ought to know better.

[FN#293] Arab. "Al-'Ariz"=the demon who possessed her.

[FN#294] i.e. He hath renounced his infamous traffic.

[FN#295] Alluding to the favourite Eastern saying, "The poor man
hath no life."

[FN#296] In this and the following lines some change is necessary
for the Bresl. and Mac. texts are very defective. The Arabic word
here translated "recess" is "Aywan," prop. a hall, an open
saloon.

[FN#297] i.e. by selling it for thirty thousand gold pieces, when
he might have got a million for it.

[FN#298] The tale is not in the Bresl. Edit.

[FN#299] Al-Khasib (= the fruitful) was the son of 'Abd al-Hamid
and  intendant of the tribute of Egypt under Harun al-Rashid, but
neither Lord nor Sultan. Lane (iii. 669) quotes three couplets in
his honour by Abu Nowas from p. 119 of "Elmacini (Al-Makin)
Historia  Saracenica."

If our camel visit not the land of Al-Khasib,  what man after
Al-Khasib shall they visit?
For generosity is not his neighbour;  nor hath it sojourned near
him;  but generosity goeth wherever he goeth:
He is a man who purchaseth praise with his wealth,  and who
knoweth that the periods of Fortune revolve.

[FN#300] The old story "Ala judi-k"= upon thy generosity, which
means  at least ten times the price.

[FN#301]i.e. The distance is enormous.

[FN#302] A gazelle but here the slave-girl's name.

[FN#303] See vol. ii. 104. Herklots (Pl. vii. fig. 2) illustrates
the cloth used in playing the Indian game, Pachisi. The "board"
is rather European than Oriental, but it has of late Years spread
far and wide, especially the backgammon board.

[FN#304] i.e. "Father of the Lion."

[FN#305] Or as we should say, "Thy blood will be on thine own
head."

[FN#306] Called after the famous town in Persian Mesopotamia
which however is spelt with the lesser aspirate. See p. 144. The
Geographical works of Sadik-i-Ispahani, London Oriental Transl.
Fund, 1882. Hamdan (with the greater aspirate) and Hamdun mean
only the member masculine, which may be a delicate piece of chaff
for the gallery

[FN#307] Arab. "Hulwan al-miftah," for which see vol. vii. 212.
Mr. Payne compares it with the French denier a Dieu. given to the
concierge on like occasions.

[FN#308] Arab. "'Udm," a relish, the Scotch "kitchen," Lat.
Opsonium, Ital. Companatico and our "by-meat." See vol. iv. 128.

[FN#309] Arab. "Kabasa" = he shampoo'd. See vol. ii. 17.

[FN#310] Arab. "Nukl." See supra p. 177.

[FN#311] Arab. "Jannat al-Khuld" and "Firdaus," two of the
Heavens repeatedly noticed.

[FN#312] The naivete is purely Horatian, that is South European
versus North European.

[FN#313] i.e. "Have some regard for thy life."

[FN#314] Arab. "Awak" plur. of ékiyyah a word known throughout
the Moslem East. As an ounce it weighs differently in every
country and in Barbary (Mauritania) which we call Morocco, it is
a nominal coin containing twelve Flus (fulus) now about = a
penny. It is a direct descendant from the "Uk" or "Wuk" (ounce)
of the hieroglyphs (See Sharpe's Egypt or any other Manual) and
first appeared in Europe as the Greek {Greek}.

[FN#315] Arab. "Karah" usually a large bag.

[FN#316] Arab. "Luluah," which may mean the Union-pearl; but here
used in the sense of wild cow, the bubalus antelope, alluding to
the farouche nature of Miss Jamilah. We are also told infra that
the park was full of "Wuhush" = wild cattle

[FN#317] Arab. "Sakiyah," the venerable old Persian wheel, for
whos music see Pilgrimage ii. 198. But Sakiyah" is also applied,
as here, to the water-channel which turns the wheel.

[FN#318] Arab. "Kawadis," plur. of "Kadus," the pots round the
rim of the Persian wheel: usually they are of coarse pottery.

[FN#319] In the text "Sakiyah" a manifest error for "Kubbah."

[FN#320] Easterns greatly respect a belle fourchette, especially
when the eater is a lover.

[FN#321] Arab. "'Arishah," a word of many meanings, tent, nest,
vine- trellis, etc.

[FN#322] To spit or blow the nose in good society is "vulgar."
Sneezing (Al-'Atsah) is a complicated affair. For Talmudic
traditions of death by sneezing see Lane (M. E. chaps. viii).
Amongst Hindus sneezing and yawning are caused by evil spirits
whom they drive away by snapping thumb and forefinger as loudly
as possible. The pagan Arabs held sneezing a bad omen, which
often stopped their journeys. Moslems believe that when Allah
placed the Soul (life ?) in Adam, the dry clay became flesh and
bone and the First Man, waking to life, sneezed and ejaculated
"Alhamdolillah;" whereto Gabriel replied, "Allah have mercy upon
thee, O Adam!" Mohammed, who liked sneezing because accompanied
by lightness of body and openness of pores, said of it, "If a man
sneeze or eructate and say 'Alhamdolillah' he averts seventy
diseases of which the least is leprosy" (Juzam); also "If one of
you sneeze, let him exclaim, 'Alhamdolillah,' and let those
around salute him in return with, 'Allah have mercy upon thee!'
and lastly let him say, 'Allah direct you and strengthen your
condition."' Moderns prefer, "Allah avert what may joy thy foe
!"= (our God bless you!) to which the answer is "Alhamdolillah!"
Mohammed disliked yawning (Suaba or Thuaba), because not
beneficial as a sneeze and said, "If one of you gape and over not
his mouth, a devil leaps into it. " This is still a popular
superstition from Baghdad to Morocco.

[FN#323] A duenna, nursery governess, etc. See vol. i. 231.

[FN#324] For this belief see the tale called "The Night of
Power," vol. vi. 180.

[FN#325] The Anglo-lndian "Kincob" (Kimkh'ab); brocade, silk
flowered with gold or silver. 

[FN#326] Lane finds a needless difficulty in this sentence, which
is far-fetched only because Kuus (cups) requires Ruus (head-tops)
byway of jingle. It means only "'Twas merry in hall when beards
wag all."

[FN#327] The Mac. Edit. gives two couplets which have already
occurred from the Bull Edit i. 540.

[FN#328] The lines are half of four couplets in vol. iv. 192; so
I quote Lane.

[FN#329].i.e. none hath pleased me. I have quoted the popular
saying, "The son of the quarter filleth not the eye." i.e. women
prefer stranger faces.

[FN#330] Here after the favourite Oriental fashion, she tells the
truth but so enigmatically that it is more deceptive than an
untruth; a good Eastern quibble infinitely more dangerous than an
honest downright lie. The consciousness that the falsehood is
part fact applies a salve to conscience and supplies a force
lacking in the mere fib. When an Egyptian lies to you look
straight in his eyes and he will most often betray himself either
by boggling or by a look of injured innocence.

[FN#331] Another true lie.

[FN#332] Arab. `'Yastaghibuni," lit. = they deem my absence too
long.

[FN#333] An euphemistic form of questioning after absence: "Is
all right with thee?"

[FN#334] Arab. "Kallim al-Sultan!" the formula of summoning which
has often occurred in The Nights.

[FN#335] Lane translates "Almost died," Payne "Well-nigh died;"
but the text says "died." I would suggest to translators

          "Be bould, be bould and every where be bould!"

[FN#336] He is the usual poltroon contrasted with the manly and
masterful girl, a conjunction of the lioness and the lamb
sometimes seen in real life.

[FN#337] That he might see Jamilah as Ibrahim had promised.

[FN#338] A popular saying, i.e., les absents ont tonjours tort.

[FN#339] Who had a prior right to marry her, but not against her
consent after she was of age.

[FN#340] Arab "Sirwal." In Al-Hariri it is a singular form (see
No. ii. of the twelve riddles in Ass. xxiv.), but Mohammed said
to his followers "Tuakhkhizu" (adopt ye) "Sarawilat." The latter
is regularly declinable but the broken form Sarawil is
imperfectly declinable on account of its "heaviness," as are all
plurals whose third letter is an Alif followed by i or i in the
next syllable.

[FN#341] Arab. "Matarik" from mitrak or mitrakah a small wooden
shield coated with hide This even in the present day is the
policeman's equipment in the outer parts of the East.

[FN#342] Arab. "Sabiyah" for which I prefer Mr. Payne's "young
lady" to Lane's "damsel" the latter should be confined to Jariyah
as both bear the double sense of girl and slave (or servant)
girl. "Bins" again is daughter, maid or simply girl.

[FN#343] The sense of them is found in vol. ii. 41.

[FN#344] Here the text is defective, but I hardly like to supply
the omission. Mr. Payne introduces from below, "for that his
charms were wasted and his favour changed by reason of the much
terror and affliction he had suffered." The next lines also are
very abrupt and unconnected.

[FN#345] Arab. "Ya Maulaya!" the term is still used throughout
Moslem lands; but in Barbary where it is pronounced "Moolaee"
Europeans have converted it to "Muley" as if it had some
connection with the mule. Even in Robinson Crusoe we find "muly"
or "Moly Ismael" (chaps. ii.); and we hear the high-sounding name
Maula-i-Idris, the patron saint of the Sunset Land, debased to
"Muley Dris."

[FN#346] Lane omits this tale because "it is very similar, but
inferior in interest, to the Story told by the Sultan's Steward."
See vol. i. 278.

[FN#347] Sixteenth Abbaside A.H. 279 289 (=A.D. 891 902). "He was
comely, intrepid, of grave exterior, majestic in presence, of
considerable intellectual power and the fiercest of the Caliphs
of the House of Abbas. He once had the courage to attack a lion"
(Al-Siyuti). I may add that he was a good soldier and an
excellent administrator, who was called Saff h the Second because
he refounded the House of Abbas. He was exceedingly fanatic and
died of sensuality, having first kicked his doctor to death, and
he spent his last moments in versifying.

[FN#348] Hamd£n bin Ism '¡l, called the K tib or Scribe, was the
first of his family who followed the profession of a Nad¡m or
Cup-companion. His son Ahmad (who is in the text) was an oral
transmitter of poetry and history. Al-Siy£ti (p. 390) and De
Slane I. Khall (ii. 304) notice him.

[FN#349] Probably the Caliph had attendants, but the text
afterwards speaks of them as two. Mac. Edit. iv. p. 558, line 2;
and a few lines below, "the Caliph and the man with him."

[FN#350] Arab. "Nays b£r," the famous town in Khorasan where
Omar-i-Khayy m (whom our people will call Omar Khayy m) was
buried and where his tomb is still a place of pious visitation. A
sketch of it has lately appeared in the illustrated papers. For
an affecting tale concerning the astronomer-poet's tomb, borrowed
from the Nig rist n see the Preface by the late Mr. Fitzgerald
whose admirable excerpts from the Rubaiyat (101 out of 820
quatrains) have made the poem popular among all the
English-speaking races.

[FN#351] Arab. "A-Shar¡f anta?" (with the Hamzah-sign of
interrogation)=Art thou a Shar¡f (or descendant of the Apostle)?

[FN#352] Tenth Abbaside (A.H. 234 247=848 861), grandson of
Al-Rashid and born of a slave-concubine. He was famous for his
hatred of the Alides (he destroyed the tomb of Al-Husayn) and
claimed the pardon of Allah for having revised orthodox
traditionary doctrines. He compelled the Christians to wear
collars of wood or leather and was assassinated by five Turks.

[FN#353] His father was Al-Mu'tasim bi 'llah (A.H.
218 227=833 842) the son of Al-Rashid by M ridah a
slave-concubine of foreign origin. He was brave and of high
spirit, but destitute of education; and his personal strength was
such that he could break a man's elbow between his fingers. He
imitated the apparatus of Persian kings; and he was called the
"Octonary" because he was the 8th Abbaside; the 8th in descent
from Abbas; the 8th son of Al-Rashid; he began his reign in A.H.
218; lived 48 years; was born under Scorpio (8th Zodiacal sign);
was victorious in 8 expeditions; slew 8 important foes and left 8
male and 8 female children. For his introducing Turks see vol.
iii, 81.

[FN#354] i.e. as if it were given away in charity.

[FN#355] Arab. "Shukkah," a word much used in the Zanzibar trade
where it means a piece of long-cloth one fathom long. See my
"Lake Regions of Central Africa," vol. i. 147, etc.

[FN#356] He is afterwards called in two places "Kh dim"=eunuch.

[FN#357] A courteous way of saying, "Never mind my name: I wish
to keep it hidden." The formula is still popular.

[FN#358] Arab. "Bakhkharan¡" i.e. fumigated me with burning
aloes-wood, Calumba or similar material.

[FN#359] In sign of honour. The threshold is important amongst
Moslems: in one of the Mameluke Soldans' sepulchres near Cairo I
found a granite slab bearing the "cartouche" (shield) of Khufu
(Cheops) with the four hieroglyphs hardly effaced.

[FN#360] i.e. One of the concubines by whose door he had passed.

[FN#361] Epistasis without the prostasis, "An she ordered thee so
to do:" the situation justifies the rhetorical figure.

[FN#362] Arab. "Sard b" see vol. i, 340.

[FN#363] Thirteenth Abbaside A.H. 252 255 (=866 869). His mother
was a Greek slave called Kab¡hah (Al-Mas'udi and Al-Siyuti); for
which "Banjah" is probably a clerical error. He was exceedingly
beautiful and was the first to ride out with ornaments of gold.
But he was impotent in the hands of the Turks who caused the mob
to depose him and kill him his death being related in various
ways.

[FN#364] i.e. The reward from Allah for thy good deed.

[FN#365] Arab. "Nusk" abstinence from women, a part of the
Zahid's asceticism.

[FN#366] Arab. "Mun zirah" the verbal noun of which, "Mun zarah,"
may also mean "dispute." The student will distinguish between
"Munazarah" and Munafarah=a contention for precedence in presence
of an umpire.

[FN#367] The Mac. Edit. gives by mistake "Ab£ D £d": the Bul.
correctly "Ab£ Duw d," He was K zi al-Kuz t (High Chancellor)
under Al-Mu'tasim, Al-Wasik bi'llah (Vathek) and Al-Mutawakkil.

[FN#368] Arab. "Zaff£"=they led the bride to the bridegroom's
house; but here used in the sense of displaying her as both were
in the palace.

[FN#369] i.e. renounce the craft which though not sinful (har m)
is makr£h or religiously unpraiseworthy; Mohammed having objected
to music and indeed to the arts in general.

[FN#370] Arab. "L  tankati'¡;" do not be too often absent from
us. I have noticed the whimsical resemblance of "Kat'" and our
"cut"; and here the metaphorical sense is almost identical.

[FN#371] See Ibn Khallikan ii. 455.

[FN#372] The Turkish body-guard. See vol. iii. 81.

[FN#373] Twelfth Abbaside (A.H. 248-252=862-866) the son of a
slave-concubine Mukharik. He was virtuous and accomplished,
comely, fair-skinned, pock-marked and famed for defective
pronunciation; and he first set the fashion of shortening men's
capes and widening the sleeves.  After may troubles with the
Turks, who were now the Praetorian guard of Baghdad, he was
murdered at the instigation of Al-Mu' tazz, who succeeded him, by
his Chamberlain Sa'id bin Salih.

[FN#374] Arab. "Usul," his forbears, his ancestors.

[FN#375] Lane rejects this tale because it is "extremely
objectionable; far more so than the title might lead me to
expect." But he quotes the following marginal note by his Shaykh:
--"Many persons (women) reckon marrying a second time amongst the
most disgraceful of actions. This opinion is commonest in the
country-towns and villages; and my mother's relations are thus
distinguished; so that a woman of them, when her husband dieth or
divorceth her while she is young, passeth in widowhood her life,
however long it may be, and disdaineth to marry a second time." I
fear that this state of things belongs to the good old days now
utterly gone by; and the loose rule of the stranger, especially
the English, in Egypt will renew the scenes which characterised
Sind when Sir Charles Napier hanged every husband who cut down an
adulterous wife. I have elsewhere noticed the ignorant idea that
Moslems deny to women souls and seats in Paradise, whilst
Mohammed canonised two women in his own family. The theory arose
with the "Fathers" of the Christian Church who simply exaggerated
the misogyny of St. Paul. St. Ambrose commenting on Corinthians
i. ii., boldly says:--"Feminas ad imaginem Dei factas non esse."
St. Thomas Aquinas and his school adopted the Aristotelian view,
"Mulier est erratum naturae, et mas occasionatus, et per accidens
generatur; atque ideo est monstrum." For other instances see
Bayle s. v. Gediacus (Revd. Simon of Brandebourg) who in 1695
published a "Defensio Sexus muliebris," a refutation of an
anti-Socinian satire or squib, "Disputatio perjucunda, Mulieres
homines non esse," Parisiis, 1693. But when Islam arose in the
seventh century, the Christian learned cleverly affixed the
stigma of their own misogyny upon the Moslems ad captandas
foeminas and in Southern Europe the calumny still bears fruit.
Mohammed (Koran, chapt. xxiv.) commands for the first time, in
the sixth year of his mission, the veiling and, by inference, the
seclusion of women, which was apparently unknown to the Badawin
and, if practised in the cities was probably of the laxest. Nor
can one but confess that such modified separation of the sexes,
which it would be impossible to introduce into European manners,
has great and notable advantages. It promotes the freest
intercourse between man and man, and thus civilises what we call
the "lower orders": in no Moslem land, from Morocco to China, do
we find the brutals without manners or morals which are bred by
European and especially by English civilisation. For the same
reason it enables women to enjoy fullest intimacy and friendship
with one another, and we know that the best of both sexes are
those who prefer the society of their own as opposed to "quite
the lady's man" and "quite the gentleman's woman." It also adds
an important item to social decorum by abolishing e.g. such
indecencies as the "ball-room flirtation"--a word which must be
borrowed from us, not translated by foreigners. And especially it
gives to religious meetings, a tone which the presence of women
modifies and not for the better. Perhaps, the best form is that
semiseclusion of the sex, which prevailed in the heroic ages of
Greece, Rome, and India (before the Moslem invasion), and which
is perpetuated in Christian Armenia and in modern Hellas. It is a
something between the conventual strictness of Al-Islam and the
liberty, or rather licence, of the "Anglo-Saxon" and the
"Anglo-American." And when England shall have cast off that
peculiar insularity which makes her differ from all civilised
peoples, she will probably abolish three gross abuses,
time-honoured scandals, which bear very heavily on women and
children. The first is the Briton's right to will property away
from his wife and offspring. The second is the action for "breach
of promise," salving the broken heart with pounds, shillings, and
pence: it should be treated simply as an exaggerated breach of
contract. The third is the procedure popularly called "Crim.
Con.," and this is the most scandalous of all: the offence is
against the rights of property, like robbery or burglary, and it
ought to be treated criminally with fine, imprisonment and in
cases with corporal punishment after the sensible procedure of
Moslem law.

[FN#376] "Moon of the age," a name which has before occurred.

[FN#377] The Malocchio or gettatura, so often noticed.

[FN#378] The crescent of the month Zu 'l-Ka'dah when the
Ramazan-fast is broken. This allusion is common. Comp. vol. i.
84.

[FN#379] This line contains one of the Yes, Yes and No, No
trifles alluded to in vol. ii, 60. Captain Lockett (M. A. 103)
renders it "I saw a fawn upon a hillock whose beauty eclipsed the
full moon. I said, What is thy name? she answered Deer. What my
Dear said I, but she replied, no, no!" To preserve the sound I
have sacrificed sense: Lulu is a pearl, Li? li? (= for me, for
me?) and La! La! = no! no! See vol. i, 217. I should have
explained a line which has puzzled some readers,

   "A sun (face) on wand (neck) in knoll of sand (hips) she
        showed" etc,

[FN#380] Arab. "Al-huwayna," a rare term.

[FN#381] Bright in the eyes of the famishing who is allowed to
break his fast.

[FN#382] Mr. Payne reads "Maghrabi" = a Mauritanian, Maroccan,
the Moors (not the Moorish Jews or Arabs) being a race of
Sodomites from highest to lowest. But the Mac. and Bul. Edit.
have "Ajami."

[FN#383] For "Ishk uzri" = platonic love see vol. i. 232; ii.
104.

[FN#384] Zaynab (Zenobia) and Zayd are generic names for women
and men.

[FN#385] i.e. He wrote "Kasidahs" (= odes, elegies) after the
fashion of the "Suspended Poems" which mostly open with the lover
gazing upon the traces of the camp where his beloved had dwelt.
The exaggerated conventionalism of such exordium shows that these
early poems had been preceded by a host of earlier pieces which
had been adopted as canons of poetry.

[FN#386] The verses are very mal-a-propos, like many occurring in
The Nights, for the maligned Shaykh is proof against all the
seductions of the pretty boy and falls in love with a woman after
the fashion of Don Quixote. Mr. Payne complains of the obscurity
of the original owing to abuse of the figure enallage; but I find
them explicit enough, referring to some debauched elder after the
type of Abu Nowas.

[FN#387] Arab. "'Irk" = a root which must here mean a sprig, a
twig. The basil grows to a comparatively large size in the East.

[FN#388] Arab. "Lait "= one connected with the tribe of Lot, see
vol. v. 161.

[FN#389] For the play upon "Saki" (oblique case of sak, leg-calf)
and Saki a cupbearer see vol. ii. 327.

[FN#390] "On a certain day the leg shall be bared and men shall
be called upon to bow in adoration, but they shall not be able"
(Koran, lxviii. 42). "Baring the leg" implies a grievous
calamity, probably borrowed from the notion of tucking up the
skirts and stripping for flight. On the dangerous San Francisco
River one of the rapids is called "Tira-calcoens" = take off your
trousers (Highlands of the Brazil, ii. 35). But here the allusion
is simply ludicrous and to a Moslem blasphemous.

[FN#391] Arab. "Istahi," a word of every day use in reproof. So
the Hindost. "Kuchh sharm nahin?" hast thou no shame? Shame is a
passion with Orientals and very little known to the West.

[FN#392] i.e. Angels and men saying, "The Peace (of God) be on us
and on all righteous servants of Allah!" This ends every prayer.

[FN#393] Arab. "Al-Niyah," the ceremonial purpose or intent to
pray, without which prayer is null and void. See vol. v. 163. The
words would be "I purpose to pray a two-bow prayer in this hour
of deadly danger to my soul." Concerning such prayer see vol. i.
142.

[FN#394] Arab. "Sakin" = quiescent, Let a sleeping hound lie.

[FN#395] Arab. "Asar" lit. traces i.e. the works, the mighty
signs and marvels.

[FN#396] The mention of coffee now frequently occurs in this tale
and in that which follows: the familiar use of it showing a
comparatively late date, and not suggesting the copyist's hand.

[FN#397] Arab. "Al-Kahwah," the place being called from its
produce. See Pilgrimage i. 317-18.

[FN#398] Arab. "Al-Ghurbah Kurbah:" the translation in the text
is taken from my late friend Edward Eastwick, translator of the
Gulistan and author of a host of works which show him to have
been a ripe Oriental scholar.

[FN#399] The fiction may have been suggested by the fact that in
all Moslem cities from India to Barbary the inner and outer gates
are carefully shut during the noontide devotions, not "because
Friday is the day on which creation was finished and Mohammed
entered Al-Medinah;" but because there is a popular idea that in
times now approaching the Christians will rise up against the
Moslems during prayers and will repeat the "Sicilian Vespers."

[FN#400] i.e. the syndic of the Guild of Jewellers.

[FN#401] This is an Arab Lady Godiva of the wrong sort.

[FN#402] This is explained in my Pilgrimage i. 99 et seq.

[FN#403] About three pennyweights. It varies, however, everywhere
and in Morocco the "Mezkal" as they call it is an imaginary
value, no such coin existing.

[FN#404] i.e. over and above the value of the gold, etc.

[FN#405] This was the custom of contemporary Europe and more than
one master cutler has put to death an apprentice playing Peeping
Tom to detect the secret of sword-making.

[FN#406] Among Moslems husbands are divided into three species;
(1) of "Bahr" who is married for love; (2) of "Dahr," for defence
against the world, and (3) of "Mahr" for marriage-settlements
(money). Master Obayd was an unhappy compound of the two latter;
but he did not cease to be a man of honour.

[FN#407]The Mac. Edit. here is a mass of blunders and misprints.

[FN#408] The Mac. Edit. everywhere calls her "Sabiyah" = the
young lady and does not mention her name Halimah = the Mild, the
Gentle till the cmlxxivth Night. I follow Mr. Payne's example by
introducing it earlier into the story, as it avoids vagueness and
repetition of the indefinite.

[FN#409]  Arab "Adim al-Zauk,"=without savour. applied to an
insipid mannerless man as "barid" (cold) is to a fool. "Ahl Zauk"
is a man of pleasure, a voluptuary, a hedonist.

[FN#410]  Arab. "Finjan" the egg-shell cups from which the
Easterns still drink coffee.

[FN#411]  Arab. "Awashik" a rare word, which Dozy translates
"osselet" (or osselle) and Mr. Payne, "hucklebones," concerning
which he has obliged me with this note. Chambaud renders osselet
by "petit os avec lequel les enfants jouent." Hucklebone is the
hip-bone but in the plural it applies to our cockals or cockles:
Latham gives "hucklebone," (or cockal), one of the small
vertebrae of the coccygis, and Littleton translates "Talus," a
hucklebone, a bone to play with like a dye, a play called cockal.
(So also in Rider.) Hucklebones and knucklebones are syn.: but
the latter is modern and liable to give a false idea, besides
being tautological. It has nothing to do with the knuckles and
derives from the German "Knochel" (dialectically Knochelein) a
bonelet.

[FN#412]  For ablution after sleep and before prayer. The address
of the slave-girl is perfectly natural: in a Moslem house we
should hear it this day, nor does it show the least sign of
"frowardness. "

[FN#413]  The perfect stupidity of the old wittol is told with
the driest Arab humour.

[FN#414]  This is a rechauffe of the Language of Signs in "Aziz
and Azizah" vol. ii. 302.

[FN#415]  In the Mac. Edit. "Ya Fulanah"=O certain person.

[FN#416]  Arab. "Laylat al-Kabilah," lit.=the coming night, our
to-night; for which see vol. iii. 349.

[FN#417]  Arab. "Ya Ahmak!" which in Marocco means a madman, a
maniac, a Santon.

[FN#418]  The whole passage has a grammatical double entendre
whose application is palpable. Harf al-Jarr=a particle governing
the noun in the genitive or a mode of thrusting and tumbling.

[FN#419]  Arab. "Al-Silah" =conjunctive (sentence), also coition;
Al-Mausul= the conjoined, a grammatical term for relative pronoun
or particle.

[FN#420] Arab. "Tanwin al-Izafah ma'zul" = the nunnation in
construction cast out. "Tanwin" (nunnation) is pronouncing the
vowels of the case-endings of a noun with nÄun for u
(nominative)Äin for i (genitive) andÄan for a (accusative). This
nunnation expresses indefiniteness, e.g. "Malikun"=a king, any
king. When the noun is made definite by the Ma'rifah or article
(al), the Tanwin must be dropped, e.g. Al-Maliku = the King; Al-
Malikun being a grammatical absurdity. In construction or regimen
(izafah) the nunnation must also disappear, as Maliku 'I-Hind) =
the King of Hind (a King of Hind would be Malikun min Muluki
'I-Hind) = a King from amongst the Kings of Hind). Thus whilst
the wife and the lover were conjoined as much as might be, the
hocussed and sleeping husband was dismissed (ma'zul=degraded)
like a nunnation dropped in construction. I may add that the
terminal syllables are invariably dropped in popular parlance and
none but Mr. G. Palgrave (who afterwards ignored his own
assertion) ever found an Arab tribe actually using them in
conversation although they are always pronounced when reading the
Koran and poetry.

[FN#421]  This was a saying of Mohammed about overfrequency of
visits, "Zur ghibban, tazid hubban"=call rarely that friendship
last fairly. So the verse of Al-Mutanabbi,

          "How oft familiarity breeds dislike."

Preston quotes Jesus ben Sirach, {Greek}. Also Al-Hariri (Ass.
xv. of "The Legal"; De Sacy p. 478 1. 2.) "Visit not your friend
more than one day in a month, nor stop longer than that with
him!" Also Ass. xvi. 487, 8. "Multiply not visits to thy friend."
"None so disliked as one visiting too often." (Preston p. 352).
In the Cent nouvelles (52) Nouvelles (No. lii.) the dying father
says to his son:--"Jamais ne vous hantez tent en l'ostel de votre
voisin que lion vous y serve de pain bis." In these matters
Moslems follow the preaching and practice of the Apostle, who was
about as hearty and genial as the "Great Washington." But the
Arab had a fund of dry humour which the Anglo-American lacked
altogether.

[FN#422]  Arab. "'Amal"--action, operation. In Hindostani it is
used (often with an Alif for an Ayn) as intoxication e.g. Amal
pani strong waters and applied to Sharab (wine), Bozah (Beer),
Tadi (toddy or the fermented juice of the Tad, Borassus
flabelliformis), Naryali (juice of the cocoa-nut tree) Saynddi
(of the wild date, Elate Sylvestris), Afyun (opium an its
preparations as post=poppy seeds) and various forms of Cannabis
Sativa, as Ganja, Charas, Madad, Sahzi etc. for which see
Herklots' Glossary.

[FN#423] Arab "Sardab," mostly an underground room (vol. i. 340)
but here a tunnel.

[FN#424]  Arab. "Al-Lawandiyah": this and the frequent mention of
coffee and presently of a watch (sa'ah) show that the tale in its
present state, cannot be older than the end of the sixteenth
century.

[FN#425]  Arab. "Su'ban," vol. i. 172.

[FN#426]  The lines have occurred in vol. i. 238, where I have
noted the punning "Sabr"= patience or aloes. I quote Torrens: the
Templar, however, utterly abolishes the pun in the last couplet:-
-

"The case is not at my command, but in fair Patience hand
I'm set by Him who order'th all and cloth such case command."

"Amr" here=case (circumstance) or command (order) with a
suspicion of reference to Murr=myrrh, bitterness. The reader will
note the resignation to Fate's decrees which here and in host of
places elevates the tone of the book.

[FN#427]  i.e. as one loathes that which is prohibited, and with
a loathing which makes it unlawful for me to cohabit with thee.

[FN#428]  This is quite natural to the sensitive Eastern.

[FN#429]  Hence, according to Moslem and Eastern theory generally
her lewd and treasonable conduct. But in Egypt not a few freeborn
women and those too of the noblest, would beat her hollow at her
own little game. See for instance the booklet attributed to Jalal
al-Siyuti and entitled Kitah al-Özah (Book of Explanation) fi
'Ilm al-Nikah (in the Science of Carnal Copulation). There is a
copy of it in the British Museum; and a friend kindly suppl~ed me
with a lithograph from Cairo; warning me that there are doubts
about the authorship.

[FN#430]  These lines have occurred in vol. iii. 214: I quote Mr.
Payne.

[FN#431] This ejaculation, as the waw shows, is parenthetic;
spoken either by Halimah, by Shahrazad or by the writer.

[FN#432]  Arab. "Kasr" here meaning an upper room.

[FN#433]  To avoid saying, I pardon thee.

[FN#434]  A proverbial saying which here means I could only dream
of such good luck.

[FN#435]  A good old custom amongst Moslems who have had business
transactions with each other: such acquittance of all possible
claims will be quoted on "Judgment-Day," when debts will be
severely enquired into.

[FN#436]  Arab. "Kutr (tract or quarter) Misr," vulgarly
pronounced "Masr." I may remind the reader that the Assyrians
called the Nile-valley "Musur" whence probably the Heb. Misraim a
dual form denoting Upper and Lower Egypt which are still
distinguished by the Arabs into Sa'id and Misr. The hieroglyphic
term is Ta-mera=Land of the Flood; and the Greek Aigyptos is
probably derived from Kahi-Ptah (region of the great God Ptah) or
Ma Ka Ptah (House of the soul of Ptah). The word "Cops" or
"Kopt," in Egyptian "Kubti" and pronounced "Gubti," contains the
same consonants

[FN#437]  Now an unimportant frontier fort and village dividing
Syria-Palestine from Egypt and famed for the French battle with
the Mamelukes (Feb. 19, 1799) and the convention for evacuating
Egypt. In the old times it was an important site built upon the
"River of Egypt" now a dried up Wady; and it was the chief port
of the then populous Najab or South Country. According to
Abulfeda it derived its name (the "boothy," the nest) from a hut
built there by the brothers of Joseph when stopped at the
frontier by the guards of Pharaoh. But this is usual Jewish
infection of history.

[FN#438]  Arab. "Bab." which may also="Chapter" or category. See
vol. i., 136 and elsewhere (index). In Egypt "Bab" sometimes
means a sepulchral cave hewn in a rock (plur. Biban) from the
Coptic "Bib."

[FN#439]  i.e. "The Holy," a town some three marches (60 miles)
N. East of Cairo; thus showing the honour done to our unheroic
hero. There is also a Salihlyah quarter or suburb of Damascus
famous for its cemetery of holy men, but the facetious Cits
change the name to Zalliniyah=causing to stray; in allusion to
its Kurdish population. Baron von Hammer reads "le faubourg
Adelieh" built by Al-Malik Al-Adil and founded a chronological
argument on a clerical error.

[FN#440]  Kamar al-Zaman; the normal pun on the name; a practice
as popular in the East as in the West, and worthy only of a
pickpocket in either place.

[FN#441]  Arab. "Azrar" plur. of "Zirr" and lit. = 'buttons,"
i.e. of his robe collar from which his white neck and face appear
shining as the sun.
