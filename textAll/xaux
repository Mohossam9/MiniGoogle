etch, we are wandering at random, we are exerting
ourselves only to return to the same spot; 'tis labour lost.

PISTHETAERUS
To think that I should trust to this crow, which has made me cover
more than a thousand furlongs!

EUELPIDES
And that I to this jay, which has torn every nail from my fingers!

PISTHETAERUS
If only I knew where we were....

EUELPIDES
Could you find your country again from here?

PISTHETAERUS
No, I feel quite sure I could not, any more than could
Execestides[1] find his.

f[1] A stranger who wanted to pass as an Athenian, although coming
originally for a far-away barbarian country.

EUELPIDES
Oh dear! oh dear!

PISTHETAERUS
Aye, aye, my friend, 'tis indeed the road of "oh dears" we are
following.

EUELPIDES
That Philocrates, the bird-seller, played us a scurvy trick,
when he pretended these two guides could help us to find Tereus,[1]
the Epops, who is a bird, without being born of one.  He has
indeed sold us this jay, a true son of Tharelides,[2] for
an obolus, and this crow for three, but what can they do?  Why,
nothing whatever but bite and scratch! --What's the matter with you
then, that you keep opening your beak?  Do you want us to fling
ourselves headlong down these rocks?  There is no road that way.

f[1] A king of Thrace, a son of Ares, who married Procne, the daughter
of Pandion, King of Athens, whom he had assisted against the Megarians.
He violated his sister-in-law, Philomela, and then cut out her
tongue; she nevertheless managed to convey to her sister how she had
been treated.  They both agreed to kill Itys, whom Procne had borne
to Tereus, and dished up the limbs of his own son to the father;
at the end of the meal Philomela appeared and threw the child's head
upon the table.  Tereus rushed with drawn sword upon the princesses,
but all the actors in this terrible scene were metamorph[o]sed.  Tereus
became an Epops (hoopoe), Procne a swallow, Philomela a nightingale,
and Itys a goldfinch.  According to Anacreon and Apollodorus it was
Procne who became the nightingale and Philomela the swallow, and this
is the version of the tradition followed by Aristophanes.
f[2] An Athenian who had some resemblance to a jay--so says
the scholiast, at any rate.

PISTHETAERUS
Not even the vestige of a track in any direction.

EUELPIDES
And what does the crow say about the road to follow?

PISTHETAERUS
By Zeus, it no longer croaks the same thing it did.

EUELPIDES
And which way does it tell us to go now?

PISTHETAERUS
It says that, by dint of gnawing, it will devour my fingers.

EUELPIDES
What misfortune is ours! we strain every nerve to get to the birds,[1]
do everything we can to that end, and we cannot find our way!
Yes, spectators, our madness is quite different from that of Sacas.
He is not a citizen, and would fain be one at any cost; we, on the
contrary, born of an honourable tribe and family and living in the midst
of our fellow-citizens, we have fled from our country as hard as ever
we could go. 'Tis not that we hate it; we recognize it to be great
and rich, likewise that everyone has the right to ruin himself; but
the crickets only chirrup among the fig-trees for a month or two,
whereas the Athenians spend their whole lives in chanting forth
judgments from their law-courts.[2] That is why we started off
with a basket, a stew-pot and some myrtle boughs[3] and have come
to seek a quiet country in which to settle. We are going to Tereus,
the Epops, to learn from him, whether, in his aerial flights,
he has noticed some town of this kind.

f[1] Literally, 'to go to the crows,' a proverbial expression
equivalent to our 'going to the devil.'
f[2] They leave Athens because of their hatred of lawsuits and informers;
this is the especial failing of the Athenians satirized in 'The Wasps.'
f[3] Myrtle boughs were used in sacrifices, and the founding of every
colony was started by a sacrifice.

PISTHETAERUS
Here! look!

EUELPIDES
What's the matter?

PISTHETAERUS
Why, the crow has been pointing me to something up there for some
time now.

EUELPIDES
And the jay is also opening its beak and craning its neck to show
me I know not what.  Clearly, there are some birds about here.
We shall soon know, if we kick up a noise to start them.

PISTHETAERUS
Do you know what to do?  Knock your leg against this rock.

EUELPIDES
And you your head to double the noise.

PISTHETAERUS
Well then use a stone instead; take one and hammer with it.

EUELPIDES
Good idea!  Ho there, within! Slave! slave!

PISTHETAERUS
What's that, friend! You say, "slave," to summon Epops! It would
be much better to shout, "Epops, Epops!"

EUELPIDES
Well then, Epops! Must I knock again?  Epops!

TROCHILUS
Who's there?  Who calls my master?

PISTHETAERUS
Apollo the Deliverer! what an enormous beak![1]

f[1] The actors wore masks made to resemble the birds they were supposed
to represent.

TROCHILUS
Good god! they are bird-catchers.

EUELPIDES
The mere sight of him petrifies me with terror. What a horrible monster.

TROCHILUS
Woe to you!

EUELPIDES
But we are not men.

TROCHILUS
What are you, then?

EUELPIDES
I am the Fearling, an African bird.

TROCHILUS
You talk nonsense.

EUELPIDES
Well, then, just ask it of my feet.[1]

f[1] Fear had had disastrous effects upon Euelpides' internal 
economy, and this his feet evidenced.

TROCHILUS
And this other one, what bird is it?

PISTHETAERUS
I?  I am a Cackling,[1] from the land of the pheasants.

f[1] The same mishap had occurred to Pisthetaerus.

EUELPIDES
But you yourself, in the name of the gods! what animal are you?

TROCHILUS
Why, I am a slave-bird.

EUELPIDES
Why, have you been conquered by a cock?

TROCHILUS
No, but when my master was turned into a peewit, he begged me to
become a bird too, to follow and to serve him.

EUELPIDES
Does a bird need a servant, then?

TROCHILUS
'Tis no doubt because he was a man.  At times he wants to eat a dish
of loach from Phalerum; I seize my dish and fly to fetch him some.
Again he wants some pea-soup; I seize a ladle and a pot and run
to get it.

EUELPIDES
This is, then, truly a running-bird.[1]  Come, Trochilus, do us the
kindness to call your master.

f[1] The Greek word for a wren is derived from the same root as 'to run.'

TROCHILUS
Why, he has just fallen asleep after a feed of myrtle-berries
and a few grubs.

EUELPIDES
Never mind; wake him up.

TROCHILUS
I an certain he will be angry.  However, I will wake him to please
you.

PISTHETAERUS
You cursed brute! why, I am almost dead with terror!

EUELPIDES
Oh! my god! 'twas sheer fear that made me lose my jay.

PISTHETAERUS
Ah! you great coward! were you so frightened that you let go your jay?

EUELPIDES
And did you not lose your crow, when you fell sprawling on the ground?
Pray tell me that.

PISTHETAERUS
No, no.

EUELPIDES
Where is it, then?

PISTHETAERUS
It has flown away.

EUELPIDES
Then you did not let it go?  Oh! you brave fellow!

EPOPS
Open the forest,[1] that I may go out!

f[1] No doubt there was some scenery to represent a forest.  Besides,
there is a pun intended.  The words answering for 'forests' and 'door'
in Greek only differ slightly in sound.

EUELPIDES
By Heracles! what a creature! what plumage! What means this triple crest?

EPOPS
Who wants me?

EUELPIDES
The twelve great gods have used you ill, meseems.

EPOPS
Are you chaffing me about my feathers?  I have been a man, strangers.

EUELPIDES
'Tis not you we are jeering at.

EPOPS
At what, then?

EUELPIDES
Why, 'tis your beak that looks so odd to us.

EPOPS
This is how Sophocles outrages me in his tragedies.  Know, I once
was Tereus.[1]

f[1] Sophocles had written a tragedy about Tereus, in which, no doubt,
the king finally appears as a hoopoe.

EUELPIDES
You were Tereus, and what are you now? a bird or a peacock?[1]

f[1] [O]ne would expect the question to be "bird or man." --Are you
a peacock?  The hoopoe resembles the peacock inasmuch as both have crests.

EPOPS
I am a bird.

EUELPIDES
Then where are your feathers?  For I don't see them.

EPOPS
They have fallen off.

EUELPIDES
Through illness?

EPOPS
No.  All birds moult their feathers, you know, every winter,
and others grow in their place.  But tell me, who are you?

EUELPIDES
We?  We are mortals.

EPOPS
 From what country?

EUELPIDES
 From the land of the beautiful galleys.[1]

f[1] Athens.

EPOPS
Are you dicasts?[1]

f[1] The Athenians were madly addicted to lawsuits. (See 'The Wasps.')

EUELPIDES
No, if anything, we are anti-dicasts.

EPOPS
Is that kind of seed sown among you?[1]

f[1] As much as to say, 'Then you have such things as anti-dicasts?' 
And Euelpides practically replaces, 'Very few.'

EUELPIDES
You have to look hard to find even a little in our fields.

EPOPS
What brings you here?

EUELPIDES
We wish to pay you a visit.

EPOPS
What for?

EUELPIDES
Because you formerly were a man, like we are, formerly you had
debts, as we have, formerly you did not want to pay them, like
ourselves; furthermore, being turned into a bird, you have when flying
seen all lands and seas.  Thus you have all human knowledge as well
as that of birds.  And hence we have come to you to beg you to direct
us to some cosy town, in which one can repose as if on thick coverlets.

EPOPS
And are you looking for a greater city than Athens?

EUELPIDES
No, not a greater, but one more pleasant to dwell in.

EPOPS
Then you are looking for an aristocratic country.

EUELPIDES
I?  Not at all!  I hold the son of Scellias in horror.[1]

f[1] His name was Aristocrates; he was a general and commanded
a fleet sent in aid of Corcyra.

EPOPS
But, after all, what sort of city would please you best?

EUELPIDES
A place where the following would be the most important
business transacted. --Some friend would come knocking at the door
quite early in the morning saying, "By Olympian Zeus, be at my house
early, as soon as you have bathed, and bring your children too.  I am
giving a nuptial feast, so don't fail, or else don't cross my threshold
when I am in distress."

EPOPS
Ah! that's what may be called being fond of hardships!  And what say you?

PISTHETAERUS
My tastes are similar.

EPOPS
And they are?

PISTHETAERUS
I want a town where the father of a handsome lad will stop in the street
and say to me reproachfully as if I had failed him, "Ah! Is this well done,
Stilbonides!  You met my son coming from the bath after the gymnasium
and you neither spoke to him, nor embraced him, nor took him with you,
nor ever once twitched his parts.  Would anyone call you an old 
friend of mine?"

EPOPS
Ah! wag, I see you are fond of suffering.  But there is a city of
delights, such as you want.  'Tis on the Red Sea.

EUELPIDES
Oh, no.  Not a sea-port, where some fine morning the Salaminian[1]
galley can appear, bringing a writ-server along.  Have you no Greek town
you can propose to us?

f[1] The State galley, which carried the officials of the Athenian
republic to their several departments and brought back those whose time
had expired; it was this galley that was sent to Sicily to fetch back
Alcibiades, who was accused of sacrilege.

EPOPS
Why not choose Lepreum in Elis for your settlement?

EUELPIDES
By Zeus! I could not look at Lepreum without disgust, because of
Melanthius.[1]

f[1] A tragic poet, who was a leper; there is a play, of course,
on the word Lepreum.

EPOPS
Then, again, there is the Opuntian, where you could live.

EUELPIDES
I would not be Opuntian[1] for a talent.  But come, what is it like
to live with the birds?  You should know pretty well.

f[1] An allusion to Opuntius, who was one-eyed.

EPOPS
Why, 'tis not a disagreeable life.  In the first place, one has no purse.

EUELPIDES
That does away with much roguery.

EPOPS
For food the gardens yield us white sesame, myrtle-berries,
poppies and mint.

EUELPIDES
Why, 'tis the life of the newly-wed indeed.[1]

f[1] The newly-married ate a sesame-cake, decorated with garlands
of myrtle, poppies and mint.

PISTHETAERUS
Ha! I am beginning to see a great plan, which will transfer the
supreme power to the birds, if you will but take my advice.

EPOPS
Take your advice?  In what way?

PISTHETAERUS
In what way?  Well, firstly, do not fly in all directions with open
beak; it is not dignified.  Among us, when we see a thoughtless man,
we ask, "What sort of bird is this?" and Teleas answers, "'Tis a man
who has no brain, a bird that has lost his head, a creature you cannot
catch, for it never remains in any one place."

EPOPS
By Zeus himself! your jest hits the mark.  What then is to be done?

PISTHETAERUS
Found a city.

EPOPS
We birds?  But what sort of city should we build?

PISTHETAERUS
Oh, really, really! 'tis spoken like a fool!  Look down.

EPOPS
I am looking.

PISTHETAERUS
Now look upwards.

EPOPS
I am looking.

PISTHETAERUS
Turn your head round.

EPOPS
Ah! 'twill be pleasant for me, if I end in twisting my neck!

PISTHETAERUS
What have you seen?

EPOPS
The clouds and the sky.

PISTHETAERUS
Very well! is not this the pole of the birds then?

EPOPS
How their pole?

PISTHETAERUS
Or, if you like it, the land.  And since it turns and passes through
the whole universe, it is called, 'pole.'[1]  If you build and
fortify it, you will turn your pole into a fortified city.[2]
In this way you will reign over mankind as you do over the grasshoppers
and cause the gods to die of rabid hunger

f[1] From [the word meaning] 'to turn.'
f[2] The Greek words for 'pole' and 'city' only differ by
a single letter.

EPOPS
How so?

PISTHETAERUS
The air is 'twixt earth and heaven.  When we want to go to Delphi,
we ask the Boeotians[1] for leave of passage; in the same way, when men
sacrifice to the gods, unless the latter pay you tribute, you exercise
the right of every nation towards strangers and don't allow
the smoke of the sacrifices to pass through your city and territory.

f[1] Boeotia separated Attica from Phocis.

EPOPS
By earth! by snares! by network![1] I never heard of anything
more cleverly conceived; and, if the other birds approve, I am going
to build the city along with you.

f[1] He swears by the powers that are to him dreadful.

PISTHETAERUS
Who will explain the matter to them?

EPOPS
You must yourself.  Before I came they were quite ignorant, but
since I have lived with them I have taught them to speak.

PISTHETAERUS
But how can they be gathered together?

EPOPS
Easily.  I will hasten down to the coppice to waken my dear Procne![1]
as soon as they hear our voices, they will come to us hot wing.

f[1] As already stated, according to the legend accepted by Aristophanes,
it was Procne who was turned into the  nightengale.

PISTHETAERUS
My dear bird, lose no time, I beg.  Fly at once into the coppice
and awaken Procne.

EPOPS
Chase off drowsy sleep, dear companion.  Let the sacred hymn gush
from thy divine throat in melodious strains; roll forth in soft
cadence your refreshing melodies to bewail the fate of Itys,[1] which
has been the cause of so many tears to us both.  Your pure notes rise
through the thick leaves of the yew-tree right up to the throne of Zeus,
where Phoebus listens to you, Phoebus with his golden hair.
And his ivory lyre responds to your plaintive accents; he gathers
the choir of the gods and from their immortal lips rushes a sacred chant
of blessed voices. (THE FLUTE IS PLAYED BEHIND THE SCENE.)

f[1] The son of Tereus and Procne.

PISTHETAERUS
Oh! by Zeus! what a throat that little bird possesses.  He has filled
the whole coppice with honey-sweet melody!

EUELPIDES
Hush!

PISTHETAERUS
What's the matter?

EUELPIDES
Will you keep silence?

PISTHETAERUS
What for?

EUELPIDES
Epops is going to sing again.

EPOPS (IN THE COPPICE)
Epopoi poi popoi, epopoi, popoi, here, here, quick, quick, quick,
my comrades in the air; all you who pillage the fertile lands
of the husbandmen, the numberless tribes who gather and devour
the barley seeds, the swift flying race who sing so sweetly.
And you whose gentle twitter resounds through the fields
with the little cry of tio, tio, tio, tio, tio, tio, tio, tio;
and you who hop about the branches of the ivy in the gardens;
the mountain birds, who feed on the wild olive berries or the arbutus,
hurry to come at my call, trioto, trioto, totobrix; you also, who snap up
the sharp-stinging gnats in the marshy vales, and you who dwell
in the fine plain of Marathon, all damp with dew, and you, the francolin
with speckled wings; you too, the halcyons, who flit over the swelling
waves of the sea, come hither to hear the tidings; let all the tribes
of long-necked birds assemble here; know that a clever old man has come
to us, bringing an entirely new idea and proposing great reforms.
Let all come to the debate here, here, here, here.  Torotorotorotorotix,
kikkobau, kikkobau, torotorotorotorolililix.

PISTHETAERUS
Can you see any bird?

EUELPIDES
By Phoebus, no! and yet I am straining my eyesight to scan the sky.

PISTHETAERUS
'Twas really not worth Epops' while to go and bury himself in the
thicket like a plover when a-hatching.

PHOENICOPTERUS
Torotina, torotina.

PISTHETAERUS
Hold, friend, here is another bird.

EUELPIDES
I' faith, yes, 'tis a bird, but of what kind?  Isn't it a peacock?

PISTHETAERUS
Epops will tell us.  What is this bird?

EPOPS
'Tis not one of those you are used to seeing; 'tis a bird from
the marshes.

PISTHETAERUS
Oh! oh! but he is very handsome with his wings as crimson as flame.

EPOPS
Undoubtedly; indeed he is called flamingo.[1]

f[1] An African bird, that comes to the southern countries of Europe, 
to Greece, Italy, and Spain; it is even seen in Provence.

EUELPIDES
Hi! I say! You!

PISTHETAERUS
What are you shouting for?

EUELPIDES
Why, here's another bird.

PISTHETAERUS
Aye, indeed; 'tis a foreign bird too.  What is this bird from beyond
the mountains with a look as solemn as it is stupid?

EPOPS
He is called the Mede.[1]

f[1] Aristophanes amusingly mixes up real birds with people and
individuals, whom he represents in the form of birds; he is
personifying the Medians here.

PISTHETAERUS
The Mede! But, by Heracles, how, if a Mede, has he flown here
without a camel?

EUELPIDES
Here's another bird with a crest.

PISTHETAERUS
Ah! that's curious.  I say, Epops, you are not the only one of your
kind then?

EPOPS
This bird is the son of Philocles, who is the son of Epops;[1] so
that, you see, I am his grandfather; just as one might say,
Hipponicus,[2] the son of Callias, who is the son of Hipponicus.

f[1] Philocles, a tragic poet, had written a tragedy on Tereus,
which was simply a plagiarism of the play of the same name
by Sophocles.  Philocles is the son of Epops, because he got his
inspiration from Sophocles' Tereus, and at the same time is father
to Epops, since he himself produced another Tereus.
f[2] This Hipponicus is probably the orator whose ears Alcibiades
boxed to gain a bet; he was a descendant of Callias, who was famous
for his hatred of Pisistratus.

PISTHETAERUS
Then this bird is Callias!  Why, what a lot of his feathers he
has lost![1]

f[1] This Callias, who must not be confounded with the foe
of Pisistratus, had ruined himself.

EPOPS
That's because he is honest; so the informers set upon him and the
women too pluck out his feathers.

PISTHETAERUS
By Posidon, do you see that many-coloured bird?  What is his name?

EPOPS
This one?  'Tis the glutton.

PISTHETAERUS
Is there another glutton besides Cleonymus?  But why, if he is
Cleonymus, has he not thrown away his crest?[1]  But what is the meaning
of all these crests?  Have these birds come to contend for the double
stadium prize?[2]

f[1] Cleonymus had cast away his shield; he was as great a glutton
as he was a coward.
f[2] A race in which the track had to be circled twice.

EPOPS
They are like the Carians, who cling to the crests of their
mountains for greater safety.[1]

f[1] A people of Asia Minor; when pursued by the Ionians they took
refuge in the mountains.

PISTHETAERUS
Oh, Posidon! do you see what swarms of birds are gathering here?

EUELPIDES
By Phoebus! what a cloud!  The entrance to the stage is no longer
visible, so closely do they fly together.

PISTHETAERUS
Here is the partridge.

EUELPIDES
Faith! there is the francolin.

PISTHETAERUS
There is the poachard.

EUELPIDES
Here is the kingfisher.  And over yonder?

EPOPS
'Tis the barber.

EUELPIDES
What? a bird a barber?

PISTHETAERUS
Why, Sporgilus is one.[1]  Here comes the owl.

f[1] An Athenian barber.

EUELPIDES
And who is it brings an owl to Athens?[1]

f[1] The owl was dedicated to Athene, and being respected at Athens,
it had greatly multiplied. Hence the proverb, 'taking owls to Athens,'
similar to our English 'taking coals to Newcastle.'

PISTHETAERUS
Here is the magpie, the turtle-dove, the swallow, the horned owl,
the buzzard, the pigeon, the falcon, the ring-dove, the cuckoo,
the red-foot, the red-cap, the purple-cap, the kestrel, the diver,
the ousel, the osprey, the woodpecker.

EUELPIDES
Oh! oh! what a lot of birds! what a quantity of blackbirds!
how they scold, how they come rushing up!  What a noise! what a
noise!  Can they be bearing us ill-will?  Oh! there! there! they are
opening their beaks and staring at us.

PISTHETAERUS
Why, so they are.

CHORUS
Popopopopopopopoi.  Where is he who called me?  Where am I to find him?

EPOPS
I have been waiting for you this long while!  I never fail in my
word to my friends.

CHORUS
Titititititititi.  What good thing have you to tell me?

EPOPS
Something that concerns our common safety, and that is just as
pleasant as it is to the purpose.  Two men, who are subtle reasoners,
have come here to seek me.

CHORUS
Where? What? What are you saying?

EPOPS
I say, two old men have come from the abode of men to propose a
vast and splendid scheme to us.

CHORUS
Oh! 'tis a horrible, unheard-of crime!  What are you saying?

EPOPS
Nay! never let my words scare you.

CHORUS
What have you done then?

EPOPS
I have welcomed two men, who wish to live with us.

CHORUS
And you have dared to do that!

EPOPS
Aye, and am delighted at having done so.

CHORUS
Where are they?

EPOPS
In your midst, as I am.

CHORUS
Ah! ah! we are betrayed; 'tis sacrilege!  Our friend, he who picked
up corn-seeds in the same plains as ourselves, has violated our
ancient laws; he has broken the oaths that bind all birds; he has laid
a snare for me, he has handed us over to the attacks of that impious
race which, throughout all time, has never ceased to war against us.
As for this traitorous bird, we will decide his case later, but
the two old men shall be punished forthwith; we are going to tear them
to pieces.

PISTHETAERUS
'Tis all over with us.

EUELPIDES
You are the sole cause of all our trouble.  Why did you bring me
from down yonder?

PISTHETAERUS
To have you with me.

EUELPIDES
Say rather to have me melt into tears.

PISTHETAERUS
Go to! you are talking nonsense.

EUELPIDES
How so?

PISTHETAERUS
How will you be able to cry when once your eyes are pecked out?

CHORUS
Io! io! forward to the attack, throw yourselves upon the foe,
spill his blood; take to your wings and surround them on all sides.
Woe to them! let us get to work with our beaks, let us devour them.
Nothing can save them from our wrath, neither the mountain forests,
nor the clouds that float in the sky, nor the foaming deep.
Come, peck, tear to ribbons.  Where is the chief of the cohort?  Let
him engage the right wing.

EUELPIDES
This is the fatal moment.  Where shall I fly to, unfortunate wretch
that I am?

PISTHETAERUS
Stay! stop here!

EUELPIDES
That they may tear me to pieces?

PISTHETAERUS
And how do you think to escape them?

EUELPIDES
I don't know at all.

PISTHETAERUS
Come, I will tell you.  We must stop and fight them.  Let us arm
ourselves with these stew-pots.

EUELPIDES
Why with the stew-pots?

PISTHETAERUS
The owl will not attack us.[1]

f[1] An allusion to the Feast of Pots; it was kept at Athens
on the third day of the Anthesteria, when all sorts of vegetables
were stewed together and offered for the dead to Bacchus and Athene.
This Feast was peculiar to Athens. --Hence Pisthetaerus thinks that
the owl will recognize they are Athenians by seeing the stew-pots,
and as he is an Athenian bird, he will not attack them.

EUELPIDES
But do you see all those hooked claws?

PISTHETAERUS
Seize the spit and pierce the foe on your side.

EUELPIDES
And how about my eyes?

PISTHETAERUS
Protect them with this dish or this vinegar-pot.

EUELPIDES
Oh! what cleverness! what inventive genius!  You are a great general,
even greater than Nicias,[1] where stratagem is concerned.

f[1] Nicias, the famous Athenian general. --The siege of Melos in 417 
B.C., or two years previous to the production of 'The Birds,' had
especially done him great credit.  He was joint commander of the Sicilian
expedition.

CHORUS
Forward, forward, charge with your beaks! Come, no delay.  Tear,
pluck, strike, flay them, and first of all smash the stew-pot.

EPOPS
Oh, most cruel of all animals, why tear these two men to pieces,
why kill them?  What have they done to you?  They belong to the same
tribe, to the same family as my wife.[1]

f[1] Procne, the daughter of Pandion, King of Athens.

CHORUS
Are wolves to be spared?  Are they not our most mortal foes?  So let
us punish them.

EPOPS
If they are your foes by nature, they are your friends in heart,
and they come here to give you useful advice.

CHORUS
Advice or a useful word from their lips, from them, the enemies of
my forebears!

EPOPS
The wise can often profit by the lessons of a foe, for caution
is the mother of safety.  'Tis just such a thing as one will not learn
from a friend and which an enemy compels you to know.  To begin with,
'tis the foe and not the friend that taught cities to build high
walls, to equip long vessels of war; and 'tis this knowledge that
protects our children, our slaves and our wealth.

CHORUS
Well then, I agree, let us first hear them, for 'tis best;
one can even learn something in an enemy's school.

PISTHETAERUS
Their wrath seems to cool.  Draw back a little.

EPOPS
'Tis only justice, and you will thank me later.

CHORUS
Never have we opposed your advice up to now.

PISTHETAERUS
They are in a more peaceful mood; put down your stew-pot and
your two dishes; spit in hand, doing duty for a spear, let us mount
guard inside the camp close to the pot and watch in our arsenal
closely; for we must not fly.

EUELPIDES
You are right.  But where shall we be buried, if we die?

PISTHETAERUS
In the Ceramicus;[1] for, to get a public funeral, we shall tell
the Strategi that we fell at Orneae,[2] fighting the country's foes.

f[1] A space beyond the walls of Athens which contained the gardens
of the Academy and the graves of citizens who had died for their country.
f[2] A town in Western Argolis, where the Athenians had been recently
defeated.  The somewhat similar work in Greek signifies 'birds.'

CHORUS
Return to your ranks and lay down your courage beside your wrath
as the Hoplites do.  Then let us ask these men who they are, whence
they come, and with what intent.  Here, Epops, answer me.

EPOPS
Are you calling me?  What do you want of me?

CHORUS
Who are they?  From what country?

EPOPS
Strangers, who have come from Greece, the land of the wise.

CHORUS
And what fate has led them hither to the land of the birds?

EPOPS
Their love for you and their wish to share your kind of life;
to dwell and remain with you always.

CHORUS
Indeed, and what are their plans?

EPOPS
They are wonderful, incredible, unheard of.

CHORUS
Why, do they think to see some advantage that determines them to
settle here?  Are they hoping with our help to triumph over their
foes or to be useful to their friends?

EPOPS
They speak of benefits so great it is impossible either to describe
or conceive them; all shall be yours, all that we see here, there,
above and below us; this they vouch for.

CHORUS
Are they mad?

EPOPS
They are the sanest people in the world.

CHORUS
Clever men?

EPOPS
The slyest of foxes, cleverness its very self, men of the world,
cunning, the cream of knowing folk.

CHORUS
Tell them to speak and speak quickly; why, as I listen to you,
I am beside myself with delight.

EPOPS
Here, you there, take all these weapons and hang them up inside
close to the fire, near the figure of the god who presides there and
under his protection;[1] as for you, address the birds, tell them why
I have gathered them together.

f[1] Epops is addressing the two slaves, no doubt Xanthias and Manes, 
who are mentioned later on.

PISTHETAERUS
Not I, by Apollo, unless they agree with me as the little ape of
an armourer agreed with his wife, not to bite me, nor pull me by the
parts, nor shove things up my...

CHORUS
You mean the...(PUTS FINGER TO BOTTOM) Oh! be quite at ease.

PISTHETAERUS
No, I mean my eyes.

CHORUS
Agreed.

PISTHETAERUS
Swear it.

CHORUS
I swear it and, if I keep my promise, let judges and spectators
give me the victory unanimously.

PISTHETAERUS
It is a bargain.

CHORUS
And if I break my word, may I succeed by one vote only.

HERALD
Hearken, ye people!  Hoplites, pick up your weapons and return to
your firesides; do not fail to read the decrees of dismissal we have
posted.

CHORUS
Man is a truly cunning creature, but nevertheless explain.  Perhaps
you are going to show me some good way to extend my power, some way
that I have not had the wit to find out and which you have discovered.
Speak! 'tis to your own interest as well as to mine, for if you secure
me some advantage, I will surely share it with you. But what object 
can have induced you to come among us?  Speak boldly, for I shall not 
break
the truce, --until you have told us all.

PISTHETAERUS
I am bursting with desire to speak; I have already mixed the dough
of my address and nothing prevents me from kneading it....  Slave! bring
the chaplet and water, which you must pour over my hands.  Be quick![1]

f[1] It was customary, when speaking in public and also at feasts,
to wear a chaplet; hence the question Euelpides puts. --The guests wore
chaplets of flowers, herbs, and leaves, which had the property of being
refreshing.

EUELPIDES
Is it a question of feasting?  What does it all mean?

PISTHETAERUS
By Zeus, no! but I am hunting for fine, tasty words to break down
the hardness of their hearts. --I grieve so much for you, who
at one time were kings...

CHORUS
We kings!  Over whom?

PISTHETAERUS
...of all that exists, firstly of me and of this man, even of Zeus
himself.  Your race is older than Saturn, the Titans and the Earth.

CHORUS
What, older than the Earth!

PISTHETAERUS
By Phoebus, yes.

CHORUS
By Zeus, but I never knew that before!

PISTHETAERUS
'Tis because you are ignorant and heedless, and have never read
your Aesop.  'Tis he who tells us that the lark was born
before all other creatures, indeed before the Earth; his father died
of sickness, but the Earth did not exist then; he remained unburied
for five days, when the bird in its dilemma decided, for want of
a better place, to entomb its father in its own head.

EUELPIDES
So that the lark's father is buried at Cephalae.[1]

f[1] A deme of Attica.  In Greek the word also means 'heads,'
and hence the pun.

EPOPS
Hence, if we existed before the Earth, before the gods,
the kingship belongs to us by right of priority.

EUELPIDES
Undoubtedly, but sharpen your beak well; Zeus won't be in a hurry
to hand over his sceptre to the woodpecker.

PISTHETAERUS
It was not the gods, but the birds, who were formerly the masters
and kings over men; of this I have a thousand proofs.  First of all,
I will point you to the cock, who governed the Persians before
all other monarchs, before Darius and Megabyzus.[1]  'Tis in memory
of his reign that he is called the Persian bird.

f[1] One of Darius' best generals.  After his expedition against
the Scythians, this prince gave him the command of the army which he
left in Europe.  Megabyzus took Perinthos (afterwards called Heraclea)
and conquered Thrace.

EUELPIDES
For this reason also, even to-day, he alone of all the birds wears
his tiara straight on his head, like the Great King.[1]

f[1] All Persians wore the tiara, but always on one side; the Great King
alone wore it straight on his head.

PISTHETAERUS
He was so strong, so great, so feared, that even now, on account
of his ancient power, everyone jumps out of bed as soon as ever he
crows at daybreak.  Blacksmiths, potters, tanners, shoemakers, bathmen,
corn-dealers, lyre-makers and armourers, all put on their shoes and
go to work before it is daylight.

EUELPIDES
I can tell you something about that.  'Twas the cock's fault
that I lost a splendid tunic of Phrygian wool.  I was at a feast
in town, given to celebrate the birth of a child; I had drunk pretty
freely and had just fallen asleep, when a cock, I suppose in a greater
hurry than the rest, began to crow.  I thought it was dawn and set
out for Alimos.[1]  I had hardly got beyond the walls, when a footpad
struck me in the back with his bludgeon; down I went and wanted
to shout, but he had already made off with my mantle.

f[1] Noted as the birthplace of Thucydides, a deme of Attica of
the tribe of Leontis.  Demosthenes tells us it was thirty-five stadia
from Athens.

PISTHETAERUS
Formerly also the kite was ruler and king over the Greeks.

EPOPS
The Greeks?

PISTHETAERUS
And when he was king, 'twas he who first taught them to fall
on their knees before the kites.[1]

f[1] The appearance of the kite in Greece betokened the return of
springtime; it was therefore worshipped as a symbol of that season.

EUELPIDES
By Zeus! 'tis what I did myself one day on seeing a kite; but
at the moment I was on my knees, and leaning backwards[1] with mouth
agape, I bolted an obolus and was forced to carry my bag home empty.[2]

f[1] To look at the kite, who no doubt was flying high in the sky.
f[2] As already shown, the Athenians were addicted to carrying small
coins in their mouths. --This obolus was for the purpose of buying flour
to fill the bag he was carrying

PISTHETAERUS
The cuckoo was king of Egypt and of the whole of Phoenicia.  When
he called out "cuckoo," all the Phoenicians hurried to the fields to
reap their wheat and their barley.[1]

f[1] In Phoenicia and Egypt the cuckoo makes its appearance about
harvest-time.

EUELPIDES
Hence no doubt the proverb, "Cuckoo! cuckoo! go to the fields,
ye circumcised."[1]

f[1] This was an Egyptian proverb, meaning, 'When the cuckoo sings we
go harvesting.' Both the Phoenicians and the Egyptians practised
circumcision.

PISTHETAERUS
So powerful were the birds that the kings of Grecian cities,
Agamemnon, Menelaus, for instance, carried a bird on the tip of
their sceptres, who had his share of all presents.[1]

f[1] The staff, called a sceptre, generally terminated in a piece
of carved work, representing a flower, a fruit, and most often a bird.

EUELPIDES
That I didn't know and was much astonished when I saw Priam come
upon the stage in the tragedies with a bird, which kept watching
Lysicrates[1] to see if he got any present.

f[1] A general accused of treachery.  The bird watches Lysicrates,
because, according to Pisthetaerus, he had a right to a share
of the presents.

PISTHETAERUS
But the strongest proof of all is, that Zeus, who now reigns, is
represented as standing with an eagle on his head as a symbol of his
royalty;[1] his daughter has an owl, and Phoebus, as his servant, has a
hawk.

f[1] It is thus that Phidias represents his Olympian Zeus.

EUELPIDES
By Demeter, 'tis well spoken.  But what are all these birds doing
in heaven?

PISTHETAERUS
When anyone sacrifices and, according to the rite, offers the entrails
to the gods, these birds take their share before Zeus. Formerly men always
swore by the birds and never by the gods; even now Lampon[1] swears 
by the goose,
when he wants to lie....Thus 'tis clear that you were great and 
sacred, but now you
are looked upon as slaves, as fools, as Helots; stones are thrown
at you as at raving madmen, even in holy places.  A crowd of
bird-catchers sets snares, traps, limed-twigs and nets of all sorts
for you; you are caught, you are sold in heaps and the buyers finger
you over to be certain you are fat.  Again, if they would but serve you
up simply roasted; but they rasp cheese into a mixture of oil, vinegar
and laserwort, to which another sweet and greasy sauce is added,
and the whole is poured scalding hot over your back, for all the world
as if you were diseased meat.

f[1] One of the diviners sent to Sybaris (in Magna Graecia, S. Italy)
with the Athenian colonists, who rebuilt the town under the new name
of Thurium.

CHORUS
Man, your words have made my heart bleed; I have groaned over
the treachery of our fathers, who knew not how to transmit to us the
high rank they held from their forefathers.  But 'tis a benevolent
Genius, a happy Fate, that sends you to us; you shall be our deliverer
and I place the destiny of my little ones and my own in your hands
with every confidence. But hasten to tell me what must be done;
we should not be worthy to live, if we did not seek to regain
our royalty by every possible means.

PISTHETAERUS
First I advise that the birds gather together in one city and that
they build a wall of great bricks, like that at Babylon, round the
plains of the air and the whole region of space that divides earth
from heaven.

EPOPS
Oh, Cebriones! oh, Porphyrion![1] what a terribly strong place!

f[1] As if he were saying, "Oh, gods!"  Like Lampon, he swears by the birds,
instead of swearing by the gods. --The names of these birds are those of two
of the Titans.

PISTHETAERUS
Th[en], this being well done and completed, you demand
back the empire from Zeus; if he will not agree, if he refuses and
does not at once confess himself beaten, you declare a sacred war
against him and forbid the gods henceforward to pass through your
country with lust, as hitherto, for the purpose of fondling
their Alcmenas, their Alopes, or their Semeles![1] if they try to pass
through, you infibulate them with rings so that they can work no
longer.  You send another messenger to mankind, who will proclaim to
them that the birds are kings, that for the future they must first
of all sacrifice to them, and only afterwards to the gods; that it
is fitting to appoint to each deity the bird that has most in common
with it.  For instance, are they sacrificing to Aphrodite, let them
at the same time offer barley to the coot; are they immolating a sheep
to Posidon, let them consecrate wheat in honour of the duck;[2] is a
steer being offered to Heracles, let honey-cakes be dedicated to
the gull;[3] is a goat being slain for King Zeus, there is a
King-Bird, the wren,[4] to whom the sacrifice of a male gnat is due
before Zeus himself even.

f[1] Alcmena, wife of Amphitryon, King of Thebes and mother
of Heracles. --Semele, the daughter of Cadmus and Hermione and mother
of Bacchus; both seduced by Zeus. --Alope, daughter of Cercyon,
a robber, who reigned at Eleusis and was conquered by Perseus. Alope
was honoured with Posidon's caresses; by him she had a son named
Hippothous, at first brought up by shepherds but who afterwards
was restored to the throne of his grandfather by Theseus.
f[2] Because water is the duck's domain, as it is that of Posidon.
f[3] Because the gull, like Heracles, is voracious.
f[4] The Germans still call it 'Zaunkonig' and the French 'roitelet,'
both names thus containing the idea of 'king.'

EUELPIDES
This notion of an immolated gnat delights me! And now let the great
Zeus thunder!

EPOPS
But how will mankind recognize us as gods and not as jays?  Us, who
have wings and fly?

PISTHETAERUS
You talk rubbish! Hermes is a god and has wings and flies, and
so do many other gods.  First of all, Victory flies with golden
wings, Eros is undoubtedly winged too, and Iris is compared by Homer
to a timorous dove.[1]  If men in their blindness do not recognize you
as gods and continue to worship the dwellers in Olympus, then a cloud
of sparrows greedy for corn must descend upon their fields and eat up
all their seeds; we shall see then if Demeter will mete them out
any wheat.

f[1] The scholiast draws our attention to the fact that Homer says this
of Here and not of Iris (Iliad, V, 778); it is only another proof that
the text of Homer has reached us in a corrupted form, or it may be that
Aristophanes was liable, like other people, to occasional mistakes of
quotation.

EUELPIDES
By Zeus, she'll take good care she does not, and you will see
her inventing a thousand excuses.

PISTHETAERUS
The crows too will prove your divinity to them by pecking out
the eyes of their flocks and of their draught-oxen; and then let
Apollo cure them, since he is a physician and is paid for
the purpose.[1]

f[1] In sacrifices.

EUELPIDES
Oh! don't do that! Wait first until I have sold my two young bullocks.

PISTHETAERUS
If on the other hand they recognize that you are God, the principle
of life, that you are Earth, Saturn, Posidon, they shall be loaded
with benefits.

EPOPS
Name me one of these then.

PISTHETAERUS
Firstly, the locusts shall not eat up their vine-blossoms; a legion
of owls and kestrels will devour them.  Moreover, the gnats
and the gall-bugs shall no longer ravage the figs; a flock
of thrushes shall swallow the whole host down to the very last.

EPOPS
And how shall we give wealth to mankind?  This is their strongest
passion.

PISTHETAERUS
When they consult the omens, you will point them to the richest
mines, you will reveal the paying ventures to the diviner, and not
another shipwreck will happen or sailor perish.

EPOPS
No more shall perish?  How is that?

PISTHETAERUS
When the auguries are examined before starting on a voyage, some
bird will not fail to say, "Don't start! there will be a storm,"
or else, "Go! you will make a most profitable venture."

EUELPIDES
I shall buy a trading-vessel and go to sea, I will not stay with
you.

PISTHETAERUS
You will discover treasures to them, which were buried in former
times, for you know them.  Do not all men say, "None knows where my
treasure lies, unless perchance it be some bird."[1]

f[1] An Athenian proverb.

EUELPIDES
I shall sell my boat and buy a spade to unearth the vessels.

EPOPS
And how are we to give them health, which belongs to the gods?

PISTHETAERUS
If they are happy, is not that the chief thing towards health?
The miserable man is never well.

EPOPS
Old Age also dwells in Olympus.  How will they get at it?  Must they
die in early youth?

PISTHETAERUS
Why, the birds, by Zeus, will add three hundred years to their life.

EPOPS
 From whom will they take them?

PISTHETAERUS
 From whom?  Why, from themselves.  Don't you know the cawing crow
lives five times as long as a man?

EUELPIDES
Ah! ah! these are far better kings for us than Zeus!

PISTHETAERUS
Far better, are they not?  And firstly, we shall not have to build
them temples of hewn stone, closed with gates of gold; they will
dwell amongst the bushes and in the thickets of green oak; the most
venerated of birds will have no other temple than the foliage of the
olive tree; we shall not go to Delphi or to Ammon to sacrifice;[1] but
standing erect in the midst of arbutus and wild olives and holding
forth our hands filled with wheat and barley, we shall pray them
to admit us to a share of the blessings they enjoy and shall at once
obtain them for a few grains of wheat.

f[1] A celebrated temple to Zeus in an oasis of Libya.

CHORUS
Old man, whom I detested, you are now to me the dearest of all;
never shall I, if I can help it, fail to follow your advice.
Inspirited by your words, I threaten my rivals the gods, and I
swear that if you march in alliance with me against the gods and are
faithful to our just, loyal and sacred bond, we shall soon have
shattered their sceptre. 'Tis our part to undertake the toil,
'tis yours to advise.

EPOPS
By Zeus! 'tis no longer the time to delay and loiter like
Nicias;[1] let us act as promptly as possible....  In the first place,
come, enter my nest built of brushwood and blades of straw, and tell
me your names.

f[1] Nicias was commander, along with Demosthenes, and later on
Alcibiades, of the Athenian forces before Syracuse, in the ill-fated
Sicilian Expedition, 415-413 B.C.  He was much blamed for dilatoriness
and indecision.

PISTHETAERUS
That is soon done; my name is Pisthetaerus.

EPOPS
And his?

PISTHETAERUS
Euelpides, of the deme of Thria.

EPOPS
Good! and good luck to you.

PISTHETAERUS
We accept the omen.

EPOPS
Come in here.

PISTHETAERUS
Very well, 'tis you who lead us and must introduce us.

EPOPS
Come then.

PISTHETAERUS
Oh! my god! do come back here.  Hi! tell us how we are to follow
you.  You can fly, but we cannot.

EPOPS
Well, well.

PISTHETAERUS
Remember Aesop's fables.  It is told there, that the fox fared
very ill, because he had made an alliance with the eagle.

EPOPS
Be at ease.  You shall eat a certain root and wings will grow on
your shoulders.

PISTHETAERUS
Then let us enter.  Xanthias and Manes,[1] pick up our baggage.

f[1] Servants of Pisthetaerus and Euelpides.

CHORUS
Hi! Epops! do you hear me?

EPOPS
What's the matter?

CHORUS
Take them off to dine well and call your mate, the melodious
Procne, whose songs are worthy of the Muses; she will delight our
leisure moments.

PISTHETAERUS
Oh! I conjure you, accede to their wish; for this delightful
bird will leave her rushes at the sound of your voice; for the sake of
the gods, let her come here, so that we may contemplate the
nightingale.[1]

f[1] It has already been mentioned that, according to the legend followed
by Aristophanes, Procne had been changed into a nightingale and Philomela
into a swallow.

EPOPS
Let is be as you desire.  Come forth, Procne, show yourself to these strangers.

PISTHETAERUS
Oh! great Zeus! what a beautiful little bird! what a dainty
form! what brilliant plumage![1]

f[1] The actor, representing Procne, was dressed out as a courtesan, but wore
a mask of a bird.

EUELPIDES
Do you know how dearly I should like to splint her legs for her?

PISTHETAERUS
She is dazzling all over with gold, like a young girl.[1]

f[1] Young unmarried girls wore golden ornaments; the apparel of married women
was much simpler.

EUELPIDES
Oh! how I should like to kiss her!

PISTHETAERUS
Why, wretched man, she has two little sharp points on her beak!

EUELPIDES
I would treat her like an egg, the shell of which we remove before
eating it; I would take off her mask and then kiss her pretty face.

EPOPS
Let us go in.

PISTHETAERUS
Lead the way, and may success attend us.

CHORUS
Lovable golden bird, whom I cherish above all others, you, whom
I associate with all my songs, nightingale, you have come, you have
come, to show yourself to me and to charm me with your notes.  Come,
you, who play spring melodies upon the harmonious flute,[1] lead off
our anapaests.[2]

Weak mortals, chained to the earth, creatures of clay as frail
as the foliage of the woods, you unfortunate race, whose life is but
darkness, as unreal as a shadow, the illusion of a dream, hearken
to us, who are immortal beings, ethereal, ever young and occupied
with eternal thoughts, for we shall teach you about all celestial
matters; you shall know thoroughly what is the nature of the birds,
what the origin of the gods, of the rivers, of Erebus, and Chaos;
thanks to us, even Prodicus[3] will envy you your knowledge.

At the beginning there was only Chaos, Night, dark Erebus,
and deep Tartarus.  Earth, the air and heaven had no existence.
Firstly, black-winged Night laid a germless egg in the bosom
of the infinite deeps of Erebus, and from this, after the revolution
of long ages, sprang the graceful Eros with his glittering golden wings,
swift as the whirlwinds of the tempest.  He mated in deep Tartarus
with dark Chaos, winged like himself, and thus hatched forth our race,
which was the first to see the light.  That of the Immortals did not
exist until Eros had brought together all the ingredients of the world,
and from their marriage Heaven, Ocean, Earth and the imperishable race
of blessed gods sprang into being.  Thus our origin is very much
older than that of the dwellers in Olympus.  We are the offspring
of Eros; there are a thousand proofs to show it.  We have wings and we
lend assistance to lovers.  How many handsome youths, who had sworn
to remain insensible, have not been vanquished by our power
and have yielded themselves to their lovers when almost at the end
of their youth, being led away by the gift of a quail, a waterfowl,
a goose, or a cock.[4]

And what important services do not the birds render to mortals!
First of all, they mark the seasons for them, springtime, winter,
and autumn.  Does the screaming crane migrate to Libya, --it warns
the husbandman to sow, the pilot to take his ease beside his tiller hung
up in his dwelling,[5] and Orestes[6] to weave a tunic, so that the 
rigorous cold
may not drive him any more to strip other folk. When the kite 
reappears, he tells
of the return of spring and of the period when the fleece of the sheep
must be clipped.  Is the swallow in sight?  All hasten to sell their warm tunic
and to buy some light clothing.  We are your Ammon, Delphi, Dodona, 
your Phoebus
Apollo.[7]  Before undertaking anything, whether a business transaction,
a marriage, or the purchase of food, you consult the birds by reading
the omens, and you give this name of omen[8] to all signs that tell
of the future.  With you a word is an omen, you call a sneeze an omen,
a meeting an omen, an unknown sound an omen, a slave or an ass
an omen.[9]  Is it not clear that we are a prophetic Apollo to you?
If you recognize us as gods, we shall be your divining Muses,
through us you will know the winds and the seasons, summer, winter,
and the temperate months.  We shall not withdraw ourselves
to the highest clouds like Zeus, but shall be among you and shall give
to you and to your children and the children of your children, health
and wealth, long life, peace, youth, laughter, songs and feasts;
in short, you will all be so well off, that you will be weary and
satiated with enjoyment.

Oh, rustic Muse of such varied note, tio, tio, tio, tiotinx, I sing
with you in the groves and on the mountain tops, tio, tio, tio, tio,
tiotinx.[10]  I poured forth sacred strains from my golden throat
in honour of the god Pan,[11] tio, tio, tio, tiotinx, from the top
of the thickly leaved ash, and my voice mingles with the mighty choirs
who extol Cybele on the mountain tops,[12] tototototototototinx.
'Tis to our concerts that Phrynichus comes to pillage like a bee
the ambrosia of his songs, the sweetness of which so charms the ear,
tio, tio, tio, tio, tinx.

If there be one of you spectators who wishes to spend the rest
of his life quietly among the birds, let him come to us.  All that
is disgraceful and forbidden by law on earth is on the contrary
honourable among us, the birds.  For instance, among you 'tis a crime
to beat your father, but with us 'tis an estimable deed; it's
considered fine to run straight at your father and hit him, saying,
"Come, lift your spur if you want to fight."[13]  The runaway slave,
whom you brand, is only a spotted francolin with us.[14]  Are you
Phrygian like Spintharus?[15]  Among us you would be the Phrygian bird,
the goldfinch, of the race of Philemon.[16]  Are you a slave and
a Carian like Execestides?  Among us you can create yourself
fore-fathers;[17] you can always find relations.  Does the son of Pisias
want to betray the gates of the city to the foe?  Let him become
a partridge, the fitting offspring of his father; among us there is
no shame in escaping as cleverly as a partridge.

So the swans on the banks of the Hebrus, tio, tio, tio, tio, tiotinx,
mingle their voices to serenade Apollo, tio, tio, tio, tio. tiotinx,
flapping their wings the while, tio, tio, tio, tio, tiotinx; their notes
reach beyond the clouds of heaven; all the dwellers in the forest stand
still with astonishment and delight; a calm rests upon the waters,
and the Graces and the choirs in Olympus catch up the strain, tio, tio,
tio, tio, tiotinx.

There is nothing more useful nor more pleasant than to have wings.
To begin with, just let us suppose a spectator to be dying with hunger
and to be weary of the choruses of the tragic poets; if he were
winged, he would fly off, go home to dine and come back with his
stomach filled.  Some Patroclides in urgent need would not have to 
soil his cloak, but could fly off, satisfy his requirements, and,
having recovered his breath, return.  If one of you, it matters not who,
had adu
