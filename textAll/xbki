wn part of the
sacred volume, with the readiness with which the practised counsel
would cite his authorities from the stores of legal wisdom.  In
selecting the particular chapter, she was influenced by the caption,
and she chose that which stands in our English version as "Job
excuseth his desire of death." This she read steadily, from beginning
to end, in a sweet, low and plaintive voice; hoping devoutly that
the allegorical and abstruse sentences might convey to the heart of
the sufferer the consolation he needed.  It is another peculiarity
of the comprehensive wisdom of the Bible that scarce a chapter,
unless it be strictly narration, can be turned to, that does not
contain some searching truth that is applicable to the condition of
every human heart, as well as to the temporal state of its owner,
either through the workings of that heart, or even in a still more
direct form.  In this instance, the very opening sentence - "Is
there not an appointed time to man on earth?" was startling, and
as Hetty proceeded, Hutter applied, or fancied he could apply many
aphorisms and figures to his own worldly and mental condition.  As
life is ebbing fast, the mind clings eagerly to hope when it is not
absolutely crushed by despair.  The solemn words "I have sinned;
what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men?  Why hast thou
set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself,"
struck Hutter more perceptibly than the others, and, though too
obscure for one of his blunted feelings and obtuse mind either to
feel or to comprehend in their fullest extent, they had a directness
of application to his own state that caused him to wince under
them.

"Don't you feel better now, father?" asked Hetty, closing the
volume.  "Mother was always better when she had read the Bible."

"Water," returned Hutter - "give me water, Judith.  I wonder if
my tongue will always be so hot!  Hetty, isn't there something in
the Bible about cooling the tongue of a man who was burning in Hell
fire?"

Judith turned away shocked, but Hetty eagerly sought the passage,
which she read aloud to the conscience stricken victim of his own
avaricious longings.

"That's it, poor Hetty; yes, that's it.  My tongue wants cooling,
now -what will it be hereafter?"

This appeal silenced even the confiding Hetty, for she had no
answer ready for a confession so fraught with despair.  Water, so
long as it could relieve the sufferer, it was in the power of the
sisters to give, and from time to time it was offered to the lips
of the sufferer as he asked for it.  Even Judith prayed.  As for
Hetty, as soon as she found that her efforts to make her father
listen to her texts were no longer rewarded with success, she knelt
at his side and devoutly repeated the words which the Saviour has
left behind him as a model for human petitions.  This she continued
to do, at intervals, as long as it seemed to her that the act could
benefit the dying man.  Hutter, however, lingered longer than the
girls had believed possible when they first found him.  At times
he spoke intelligibly, though his lips oftener moved in utterance
of sounds that carried no distinct impressions to the mind.  Judith
listened intently, and she heard the words - "husband" -"death"
-"pirate" - "law" - "scalps" - and several others of similar import,
though there was no sentence to tell the precise connection in
which they were used.  Still they were sufficiently expressive to
be understood by one whose ears had not escaped all the rumours
that had been circulated to her reputed father's discredit, and
whose comprehension was as quick as her faculties were attentive.

During the whole of the painful hour that succeeded, neither of
the sisters bethought her sufficiently of the Hurons to dread their
return.  It seemed as if their desolation and grief placed them
above the danger of such an interruption, and when the sound of
oars was at length heard, even Judith, who alone had any reason to
apprehend the enemy, did not start, but at once understood that the
Ark was near.  She went upon the platform fearlessly, for should
it turn out that Hurry was not there, and that the Hurons were
masters of the scow also, escape was impossible.  Then she had the
sort of confidence that is inspired by extreme misery.  But there
was no cause for any new alarm, Chingachgook, Hist, and Hurry all
standing in the open part of the scow, cautiously examining the
building to make certain of the absence of the enemy.  They, too,
had seen the departure of the Hurons, as well as the approach of
the canoe of the girls to the castle, and presuming on the latter
fact, March had swept the scow up to the platform.  A word sufficed
to explain that there was nothing to be apprehended, and the Ark
was soon moored in her old berth.

Judith said not a word concerning the condition of her father,
but Hurry knew her too well not to understand that something was
more than usually wrong.  He led the way, though with less of his
confident bold manner than usual, into the house, and penetrating
to the inner room, found Hutter lying on his back with Hetty sitting at
his side, fanning him with pious care.  The events of the morning
had sensibly changed the manner of Hurry.  Notwithstanding his skill
as a swimmer, and the readiness with which he had adopted the only
expedient that could possibly save him, the helplessness of being
in the water, bound hand and foot, had produced some such effect
on him, as the near approach of punishment is known to produce on
most criminals, leaving a vivid impression of the horrors of death
upon his mind, and this too in connection with a picture of bodily
helplessness; the daring of this man being far more the offspring
of vast physical powers, than of the energy of the will, or even
of natural spirit.  Such heroes invariably lose a large portion of
their courage with the failure of their strength, and though Hurry
was now unfettered and as vigorous as ever, events were too recent
to permit the recollection of his late deplorable condition to be
at all weakened.  Had he lived a century, the occurrences of the
few momentous minutes during which he was in the lake would have
produced a chastening effect on his character, if not always on
his manner.

Hurry was not only shocked when he found his late associate in
this desperate situation, but he was greatly surprised.  During
the struggle in the building, he had been far too much occupied
himself to learn what had befallen his comrade, and, as no deadly
weapon had been used in his particular case, but every effort had
been made to capture him without injury, he naturally believed
that Hutter had been overcome, while he owed his own escape to his
great bodily strength, and to a fortunate concurrence of extraordinary
circumstances.  Death, in the silence and solemnity of a chamber,
was a novelty to him.  Though accustomed to scenes of violence, he
had been unused to sit by the bedside and watch the slow beating of
the pulse, as it gradually grew weaker and weaker.  Notwithstanding
the change in his feelings, the manners of a life could not be
altogether cast aside in a moment, and the unexpected scene extorted
a characteristic speech from the borderer.

"How now!  old Tom," he said, "have the vagabonds got you at an
advantage, where you're not only down, but are likely to be kept
down!  I thought you a captyve it's true, but never supposed you
so hard run as this!"

Hutter opened his glassy eyes, and stared wildly at the speaker.
A flood of confused recollections rushed on his wavering mind at
the sight of his late comrade.  It was evident that he struggled
with his own images, and knew not the real from the unreal.

"Who are you?" he asked in a husky whisper, his failing strength
refusing to aid him in a louder effort of his voice.

"Who are you?  - You look like the mate of 'The Snow' - he was a
giant, too, and near overcoming us."

"I'm your mate, Floating Tom, and your comrade, but have nothing to
do with any snow.  It's summer now, and Harry March always quits
the hills as soon after the frosts set in, as is convenient."

"I know you - Hurry Skurry - I'll sell you a scalp!  - a sound one,
and of a full grown man - What'll you give?"

"Poor Tom!  That scalp business hasn't turned out at all profitable,
and I've pretty much concluded to give it up; and to follow a less
bloody calling."

"Have you got any scalp?  Mine's gone - How does it feel to have
a scalp?  I know how it feels to lose one - fire and flames about
the brain - and a wrenching at the heart - no - no - kill first,
Hurry, and scalp afterwards."

"What does the old fellow mean, Judith?  He talks like one that
is getting tired of the business as well as myself.  Why have you
bound up his head?  or, have the savages tomahawked him about the
brains?"

"They have done that for him which you and he, Harry March, would
have so gladly done for them.  His skin and hair have been torn
from his head to gain money from the governor of Canada, as you
would have torn theirs from the heads of the Hurons, to gain money
from the Governor of York."

Judith spoke with a strong effort to appear composed, but it was
neither in her nature, nor in the feeling of the moment to speak
altogether without bitterness.  The strength of her emphasis,
indeed, as well as her manner, caused Hetty to look up reproachfully.

"These are high words to come from Thomas Hutter's darter, as Thomas
Hutter lies dying before her eyes," retorted Hurry.

"God be praised for that!  - whatever reproach it may bring on my
poor mother, I am not Thomas Hutter's daughter."

"Not Thomas Hutter's darter!  - Don't disown the old fellow in his
last moments, Judith, for that's a sin the Lord will never overlook.
If you're not Thomas Hutter's darter, whose darter be you?"

This question rebuked the rebellious spirit of Judith, for,
in getting rid of a parent whom she felt it was a relief to find
she might own she had never loved, she overlooked the important
circumstance that no substitute was ready to supply his place.

"I cannot tell you, Harry, who my father was," she answered
more mildly; "I hope he was an honest man, at least."

"Which is more than you think was the case with old Hutter?
Well, Judith, I'll not deny that hard stories were in circulation
consarning Floating Tom, but who is there that doesn't get a scratch,
when an inimy holds the rake?  There's them that say hard things
of me, and even you, beauty as you be, don't always escape."

This was said with a view to set up a species of community of
character between the parties, and as the politicians are wont to
express it, with ulterior intentions.  What might have been the
consequences with one of Judith's known spirit, as well as her
assured antipathy to the speaker, it is not easy to say, for, just
then, Hutter gave unequivocal signs that his last moment was nigh.
Judith and Hetty had stood by the dying bed of their mother, and
neither needed a monitor to warn them of the crisis, and every sign
of resentment vanished from the face of the first.  Hutter opened
his eyes, and even tried to feel about him with his hands, a sign
that sight was failing.  A minute later, his breathing grew ghastly;
a pause totally without respiration followed; and, then, succeeded
the last, long drawn sigh, on which the spirit is supposed to
quit the body.  This sudden termination of the life of one who had
hitherto filled so important a place in the narrow scene on which
he had been an actor, put an end to all discussion.

The day passed by without further interruption, the Hurons, though
possessed of a canoe, appearing so far satisfied with their success
as to have relinquished all immediate designs on the castle.  It
would not have been a safe undertaking, indeed, to approach it
under the rifles of those it was now known to contain, and it is
probable that the truce was more owing to this circumstance than
to any other.  In the mean while the preparations were made for the
interment of Hutter.  To bury him on the land was impracticable,
and it was Hetty's wish that his body should lie by the side of
that of her mother, in the lake.  She had it in her power to quote
one of his speeches, in which he himself had called the lake the
"family burying ground," and luckily this was done without the
knowledge of her sister, who would have opposed the plan, had she
known it, with unconquerable disgust.  But Judith had not meddled
with the arrangement, and every necessary disposition was made
without her privity or advice.

The hour chosen for the rude ceremony was just as the sun was
setting, and a moment and a scene more suited to paying the last
offices to one of calm and pure spirit could not have been chosen.
There are a mystery and a solemn dignity in death, that dispose the
living to regard the remains of even a malefactor with a certain
degree of reverence.  All worldly distinctions have ceased; it
is thought that the veil has been removed, and that the character
and destiny of the departed are now as much beyond human opinions,
as they are beyond human ken.  In nothing is death more truly a
leveller than in this, since, while it may be impossible absolutely
to confound the great with the low, the worthy with the unworthy,
the mind feels it to be arrogant to assume a right to judge of
those who are believed to be standing at the judgment seat of God.
When Judith was told that all was ready, she went upon the platform,
passive to the request of her sister, and then she first took heed
of the arrangement.  The body was in the scow, enveloped in a sheet,
and quite a hundred weight of stones, that had been taken from the
fire place, were enclosed with it, in order that it might sink.
No other preparation seemed to be thought necessary, though Hetty
carried her Bible beneath her arm.

When all were on board the Ark, the singular habitation of the
man whose body it now bore to its final abode, was set in motion.
Hurry was at the oars.  In his powerful hands, indeed, they seemed
little more than a pair of sculls, which were wielded without
effort, and, as he was expert in their use, the Delaware remained
a passive spectator of the proceedings.  The progress of the Ark
had something of the stately solemnity of a funeral procession, the
dip of the oars being measured, and the movement slow and steady.
The wash of the water, as the blades rose and fell, kept time with
the efforts of Hurry, and might have been likened to the measured
tread of mourners.  Then the tranquil scene was in beautiful
accordance with a rite that ever associates with itself the idea
of God.  At that instant, the lake had not even a single ripple on
its glassy surface, and the broad panorama of woods seemed to look
down on the holy tranquillity of the hour and ceremony in melancholy
stillness.  Judith was affected to tears, and even Hurry, though he
hardly knew why, was troubled.  Hetty preserved the outward signs
of tranquillity, but her inward grief greatly surpassed that of her
sister, since her affectionate heart loved more from habit and long
association, than from the usual connections of sentiment and taste.
She was sustained by religious hope, however, which in her simple
mind usually occupied the space that worldly feelings filled in
that of Judith, and she was not without an expectation of witnessing
some open manifestation of divine power, on an occasion so solemn.
Still she was neither mystical nor exaggerated; her mental imbecility
denying both.  Nevertheless her thoughts had generally so much of
the purity of a better world about them that it was easy for her
to forget earth altogether, and to think only of heaven.  Hist
was serious, attentive and interested, for she had often seen the
interments of the pale-faces, though never one that promised to
be as peculiar as this; while the Delaware, though grave, and also
observant, in his demeanor was stoical and calm.

Hetty acted as pilot, directing Hurry how to proceed, to find that
spot in the lake which she was in the habit of terming "mother's
grave."  The reader will remember that the castle stood near
the southern extremity of a shoal that extended near half a mile
northerly, and it was at the farthest end of this shallow water
that Floating Tom had seen fit to deposit the remains of his wife
and child.  His own were now in the course of being placed at their
side.  Hetty had marks on the land by which she usually found the
spot, although the position of the buildings, the general direction
of the shoal, and the beautiful transparency of the water all aided
her, the latter even allowing the bottom to be seen.  By these means
the girl was enabled to note their progress, and at the proper time
she approached March, whispering, "Now, Hurry you can stop rowing.
We have passed the stone on the bottom, and mother's grave is near."

March ceased his efforts, immediately dropping the kedge and taking
the warp in his hand in order to check the scow.  The Ark turned
slowly round under this restraint, and when it was quite stationary,
Hetty was seen at its stern, pointing into the water, the tears
streaming from her eyes, in ungovernable natural feeling.  Judith
had been present at the interment of her mother, but she had never
visited the spot since.  The neglect proceeded from no indifference
to the memory of the deceased; for she had loved her mother, and
bitterly had she found occasion to mourn her loss; but she was
averse to the contemplation of death; and there had been passages
in her own life since the day of that interment which increased
this feeling, and rendered her, if possible, still more reluctant to
approach the spot that contained the remains of one whose severe
lessons of female morality and propriety had been deepened and
rendered doubly impressive by remorse for her own failings.  With
Hetty, the case had been very different.  To her simple and innocent
mind, the remembrance of her mother brought no other feeling than
one of gentle sorrow; a grief that is so often termed luxurious
even, because it associates with itself the images of excellence and
the purity of a better state of existence.  For an entire summer,
she had been in the habit of repairing to the place after night-fall;
and carefully anchoring her canoe so as not to disturb the body,
she would sit and hold fancied conversations with the deceased,
sing sweet hymns to the evening air, and repeat the orisons that
the being who now slumbered below had taught her in infancy.  Hetty
had passed her happiest hours in this indirect communion with the
spirit of her mother; the wildness of Indian traditions and Indian
opinions, unconsciously to herself, mingling with the Christian lore
received in childhood.  Once she had even been so far influenced
by the former as to have bethought her of performing some of those
physical rites at her mother's grave which the redmen are known to
observe; but the passing feeling had been obscured by the steady,
though mild light of Christianity, which never ceased to burn in her
gentle bosom.  Now her emotions were merely the natural outpourings
of a daughter that wept for a mother whose love was indelibly
impressed on the heart, and whose lessons had been too earnestly
taught to be easily forgotten by one who had so little temptation
to err.

There was no other priest than nature at that wild and singular
funeral rite.  March cast his eyes below, and through the transparent
medium of the clear water, which was almost as pure as air, he saw
what Hetty was accustomed to call "mother's grave."  It was a low,
straggling mound of earth, fashioned by no spade, out of a corner
of which gleamed a bit of the white cloth that formed the shroud
of the dead.  The body had been lowered to the bottom, and Hutter
brought earth from the shore and let it fall upon it, until all was
concealed.  In this state the place had remained until the movement
of the waters revealed the solitary sign of the uses of the spot
that has just been mentioned.

Even the most rude and brawling are chastened by the ceremonies
of a funeral.  March felt no desire to indulge his voice in any of
its coarse outbreakings, and was disposed to complete the office
he had undertaken in decent sobriety.  Perhaps he reflected on the
retribution that had alighted on his late comrade, and bethought
him of the frightful jeopardy in which his own life had so lately
been placed.  He signified to Judith that all was ready, received
her directions to proceed, and, with no other assistant than his
own vast strength, raised the body and bore it to the end of the
scow.  Two parts of a rope were passed beneath the legs and shoulders,
as they are placed beneath coffins, and then the corpse was slowly
lowered beneath the surface of the lake.

"Not there - Harry March - no, not there," said Judith, shuddering
involuntarily; "do not lower it quite so near the spot where mother
lies!"

"Why not, Judith?" asked Hetty, earnestly.  "They lived together
in life, and should lie together in death."

"No - no - Harry March, further off - further off.  Poor Hetty,
you know not what you say.  Leave me to order this."

"I know I am weak-minded, Judith, and that you are clever - but,
surely a husband should be placed near a wife.  Mother always said
that this was the way they bury in Christian churchyards."

This little controversy was conducted earnestly, but in smothered
voices, as if the speakers feared that the dead might overhear
them.  Judith could not contend with her sister at such a moment,
but a significant gesture induced March to lower the body at a
little distance from that of his wife; when he withdrew the cords,
and the act was performed.

"There's an end of Floating Tom!" exclaimed Hurry, bending over the
scow, and gazing through the water at the body.  "He was a brave
companion on a scout, and a notable hand with traps.  Don't weep,
Judith, don't be overcome, Hetty, for the righteousest of us all
must die; and when the time comes, lamentations and tears can't
bring the dead to life.  Your father will be a loss to you, no
doubt; most fathers are a loss, especially to onmarried darters;
but there's a way to cure that evil, and you're both too young and
handsome to live long without finding it out.  When it's agreeable to
hear what an honest and onpretending man has to say, Judith,
I should like to talk a little with you, apart."

Judith had scarce attended to this rude attempt of Hurry's at
consolation, although she necessarily understood its general drift,
and had a tolerably accurate notion of its manner.  She was weeping
at the recollection of her mother's early tenderness, and painful
images of long forgotten lessons and neglected precepts were
crowding her mind.  The words of Hurry, however, recalled her to
the present time, and abrupt and unseasonable as was their import,
they did not produce those signs of distaste that one might have
expected from the girl's character.  On the contrary, she appeared
to be struck with some sudden idea, gazed intently for a moment
at the young man, dried her eyes, and led the way to the other end
of the scow, signifying her wish for him to follow.  Here she took
a seat and motioned for March to place himself at her side.  The
decision and earnestness with which all this was done a little
intimidated her companion, and Judith found it necessary to open
the subject herself.

"You wish to speak to me of marriage, Harry March," she said, "and
I have come here, over the grave of my parents, as it might be -no
- no - over the grave of my poor, dear, dear, mother, to hear what
you have to say."

"This is oncommon, and you have a skearful way with you this evening,
Judith," answered Hurry, more disturbed than he would have cared
to own, "but truth is truth, and it shall come out, let what will
follow.  You well know, gal, that I've long thought you the comeliest
young woman my eyes ever beheld, and that I've made no secret
of that fact, either here on the lake, out among the hunters
and trappers, or in the settlements."

"Yes - yes, I've heard this before, and I suppose it to be true,"
answered Judith with a sort of feverish impatience.

"When a young man holds such language of any particular young woman,
it's reasonable to calculate he sets store by her."

"True - true, Hurry - all this you've told me, again and again."

"Well, if it's agreeable, I should think a woman coul'n't hear it
too often.  They all tell me this is the way with your sex, that
nothing pleases them more than to repeat over and over, for the
hundredth time, how much you like 'em, unless it be to talk to 'em
of their good looks!"

"No doubt - we like both, on most occasions, but this is an uncommon
moment, Hurry, and vain words should not be too freely used.  I
would rather hear you speak plainly."

"You shall have your own way, Judith, and I some suspect you always
will.  I've often told you that I not only like you better than
any other young woman going, or, for that matter, better than all
the young women going, but you must have obsarved, Judith, that
I've never asked you, in up and down tarms, to marry me."

"I have observed both," returned the girl, a smile struggling
about her beautiful mouth, in spite of the singular and engrossing
intentness which caused her cheeks to flush and lighted her eyes
with a brilliancy that was almost dazzling - "I have observed both,
and have thought the last remarkable for a man of Harry
March's decision and fearlessness."

"There's been a reason, gal, and it's one that troubles me even
now-nay, don't flush up so, and look fiery like, for there are
thoughts which will stick long in any man's mind, as there be words
that will stick in his throat - but, then ag'in, there's feelin's
that will get the better of 'em all, and to these feelin's I find
I must submit.  You've no longer a father, or a mother, Judith, and
it's morally unpossible that you and Hetty could live here, alone,
allowing it was peace and the Iroquois was quiet; but, as matters
stand, not only would you starve, but you'd both be prisoners, or
scalped, afore a week was out.  It's time to think of a change and
a husband, and, if you'll accept of me, all that's past shall be
forgotten, and there's an end on't."

Judith had difficulty in repressing her impatience until this rude
declaration and offer were made, which she evidently wished to
hear, and which she now listened to with a willingness that might
well have excited hope.  She hardly allowed the young man to conclude,
so eager was she to bring him to the point, and so ready to answer.

"There - Hurry - that's enough," she said, raising a hand as if to
stop him -"I understand you as well as if you were to talk a month.
You prefer me to other girls, and you wish me to become your wife."

"You put it in better words than I can do, Judith, and I
wish you to fancy them said just as you most like to hear 'em."

"They're plain enough, Harry, and 'tis fitting they should be so.
This is no place to trifle or deceive in.  Now, listen to my answer,
which shall be, in every tittle, as sincere as your offer.  There
is a reason, March, why I should never -

"I suppose I understand you, Judith, but if I'm willing to overlook
that reason, it's no one's consarn but mine - Now, don't brighten
up like the sky at sundown, for no offence is meant, and
none should be taken."

"I do not brighten up, and will not take offence," said Judith,
struggling to repress her indignation, in a way she had never found
it necessary to exert before.  "There is a reason why I should
not, cannot, ever be your wife, Hurry, that you seem to overlook,
and which it is my duty now to tell you, as plainly as you have
asked me to consent to become so.  I do not, and I am certain that
I never shall, love you well enough to marry you.  No man can wish
for a wife who does not prefer him to all other men, and when I
tell you this frankly, I suppose you yourself will thank me for my
sincerity."

"Ah!  Judith, them flaunting, gay, scarlet-coated officers of the
garrisons have done all this mischief!"

"Hush, March; do not calumniate a daughter over her mother's grave!
Do not, when I only wish to treat you fairly, give me reason to
call for evil on your head in bitterness of heart!  Do not forget
that I am a woman, and that you are a man; and that I have neither
father, nor brother, to revenge your words!"

"Well, there is something in the last, and I'll say no more.  Take
time, Judith, and think better on this."

"I want no time - my mind has long been made up, and I have
only waited for you to speak plainly, to answer plainly.  We now
understand each other, and there is no use in saying any more."

The impetuous earnestness of the girl awed the young man, for
never before had he seen her so serious and determined.  In most,
of their previous interviews she had met his advances with evasion
or sarcasm, but these Hurry had mistaken for female coquetry, and
had supposed might easily be converted into consent.  The struggle
had been with himself, about offering, nor had he ever seriously
believed it possible that Judith would refuse to become the wife
of the handsomest man on all that frontier.  Now that the refusal
came, and that in terms so decided as to put all cavilling out of
the question; if not absolutely dumbfounded, he was so much mortified
and surprised as to feel no wish to attempt to change her resolution.

"The Glimmerglass has now no great call for me," he exclaimed after
a minute's silence.  "Old Tom is gone, the Hurons are as plenty on
the shore as pigeons in the woods, and altogether it is getting to
be an onsuitable place."

"Then leave it.  You see it is surrounded by dangers, and there is
no reason why you should risk your life for others.  Nor do I know
that you can be of any service to us.  Go, tonight; we'll never
accuse you of having done any thing forgetful, or unmanly."

"If I do go, 'twill be with a heavy heart on your account, Judith;
I would rather take you with me."

"That is not to be spoken of any longer, March; but, I will land
you in one of the canoes, as soon as it is dark and you can strike
a trail for the nearest garrison.  When you reach the fort, if
you send a party -"

Judith smothered the words, for she felt that it was humiliating
to be thus exposing herself to the comments and reflections of one
who was not disposed to view her conduct in connection with all
in those garrisons, with an eye of favor.  Hurry, however, caught
the idea, and without perverting it, as the girl dreaded, he answered
to the purpose.

"I understand what you would say, and why you don't say it." he
replied.  "If I get safe to the fort, a party shall start on the
trail of these vagabonds, and I'll come with it, myself, for I
should like to see you and Hetty in a place of safety, before we
part forever."

"Ah, Harry March, had you always spoken thus, felt thus, my feelings
towards you might have been different!"

"Is it too late, now, Judith?  I'm rough and a woodsman, but we all
change under different treatment from what we have been used to."

"It is too late, March.  I can never feel towards you, or any
other man but one, as you would wish to have me.  There, I've said
enough, surely, and you will question me no further.  As soon as
it is dark, I or the Delaware will put you on the shore.  You will
make the best of your way to the Mohawk, and the nearest garrison,
and send all you can to our assistance.  And, Hurry, we are now
friends, and I may trust in you, may I not?"

"Sartain, Judith; though our fri'ndship would have been all the
warmer, could you look upon me as I look upon you."

Judith hesitated, and some powerful emotion was struggling within
her.  Then, as if determined to look down all weaknesses, and
accomplish her purposes at every hazard, she spoke more plainly.

"You will find a captain of the name of Warley at the nearest
post,"  she said, pale as death, and even trembling as she spoke;
"I think it likely he will wish to head the party, but I would
greatly prefer it should be another.  If Captain Warley can be kept
back, 't would make me very happy!"

"That's easier said than done, Judith, for these officers do
pretty much as they please.  The Major will order, and captains,
and lieutenants, and ensigns must obey.  I know the officer you
mean, a red faced, gay, oh!  be joyful sort of a gentleman, who
swallows madeira enough to drown the Mohawk, and yet a pleasant
talker.  All the gals in the valley admire him, and they say he
admires all the gals.  I don't wonder he is your dislike, Judith,
for he's a very gin'ral lover, if he isn't a gin'ral officer."

Judith did not answer, though her frame shook, and her colour
changed from pale to crimson, and from crimson back again to the
hue of death.

"Alas!  my poor mother!" she ejaculated mentally instead of uttering
it aloud, "We are over thy grave, but little dost thou know how
much thy lessons have been forgotten; thy care neglected; thy love
defeated!"

As this goading of the worm that never dies was felt, she arose
and signified to Hurry, that she had no more to communicate.



Chapter XXII.


    "That point in misery, which makes the oppressed man regardless
     of his own life, makes him too Lord of the oppressor's."

    Coleridge, Remorse, V.i.201-04.

All this time Hetty had remained seated in the head of the scow,
looking sorrowfully into the water which held the body of her mother,
as well as that of the man whom she had been taught to consider her
father.  Hist stood near her in gentle quiet, but had no consolation
to offer in words.  The habits of her people taught her reserve in
this respect, and the habits of her sex induced her to wait patiently
for a moment when she might manifest some soothing sympathy by
means of acts, rather than of speech.  Chingachgook held himself a
little aloof, in grave reserve, looking like a warrior, but feeling
like a man.

Judith joined her sister with an air of dignity and solemnity it
was not her practice to show, and, though the gleamings of anguish
were still visible on her beautiful face, when she spoke it was
firmly and without tremor.  At that instant Hist and the Delaware
withdrew, moving towards Hurry, in the other end of the boat.

"Sister," said Judith kindly, "I have much to say to you; we will
get into this canoe, and paddle off to a distance from the Ark -The
secrets of two orphans ought not to be heard by every ear."

"Certainly, Judith, by the ears of their parents?  Let Hurry lift
the grapnel and move away with the Ark, and leave us here, near
the graves of father and mother, to say what we may have to say."

"Father!" repeated Judith slowly, the blood for the first time since
her parting with March mounting to her cheeks - "He was no father
of ours, Hetty!  That we had from his own mouth, and in his dying
moments."

"Are you glad, Judith, to find you had no father!  He took care of
us, and fed us, and clothed us, and loved us; a father could have
done no more.  I don't understand why he wasn't a father."

"Never mind, dear child, but let us do as you have said.  It may
be well to remain here, and let the Ark move a little away.  Do you
prepare the canoe, and I will tell Hurry and the Indians our wishes."

This was soon and simply done, the Ark moving with measured strokes
of the sweeps a hundred yards from the spot, leaving the girls
floating, seemingly in air, above the place of the dead; so buoyant
was the light vessel that held them, and so limpid the element by
which it was sustained.

"The death of Thomas Hutter," Judith commenced, after a short
pause had prepared her sister to receive her communications, "has
altered all our prospects, Hetty.  If he was not our father, we
are sisters, and must feel alike and live together."

"How do I know, Judith, that you wouldn't be as glad to find I am
not your sister, as you are in finding that Thomas Hutter, as you
call him, was not your father.  I am only half witted, and few people
like to have half witted relations; and then I'm not handsome - at
least, not as handsome as you - and you may wish a handsomer sister."

"No, no Hetty.  You and you only are my sister - my heart, and
my love for you tell me that - and mother was my mother - of that
too am I glad, and proud; for she was a mother to be proud of -but
father was not father!"

"Hush, Judith!  His spirit may be near; it would grieve it to
hear his children talking so, and that, too, over his very grave.
Children should never grieve parents, mother often told me, and
especially when they are dead!"

"Poor Hetty!  They are happily removed beyond all cares on our
account.  Nothing that I can do or say will cause mother any sorrow
now -there is some consolation in that, at least!  And nothing you
can say or do will make her smile, as she used to smile on your
good conduct when living."

"You don't know that, Judith.  Spirits can see, and mother may
see as well as any spirit.  She always told us that God saw all we
did, and that we should do nothing to offend him; and now she has
left us, I strive to do nothing that can displease her.  Think how
her spirit would mourn and feel sorrow, Judith, did it see either
of us doing what is not right; and spirits may see, after all;
especially the spirits of parents that feel anxious about their
children."

"Hetty - Hetty - you know not what you say!" murmured Judith,
almost livid with emotion - "The dead cannot see, and know nothing
of what passes here!  But, we will not talk of this any longer.
The bodies of Mother and Thomas Hutter lie together in the lake,
and we will hope that the spirits of both are with God.  That we,
the children of one of them, remain on earth is certain; it is now
proper to know what we are to do in future."

"If we are not Thomas Hutter's children, Judith, no one will dispute
our right to his property.  We have the castle and the Ark, and
the canoes, and the woods, and the lakes, the same as when he was
living, and what can prevent us from staying here, and passing our
lives just as we ever have done?"

"No, no poor sister - this can no longer be.  Two girls would not
be safe here, even should these Hurons fail in getting us into their
power.  Even father had as much as he could sometimes do, to keep
peace upon the lake, and we should fail altogether.  We must quit
this spot, Hetty, and remove into the settlements."

"I am sorry you think so, Judith," returned Hetty, dropping her
head on her bosom, and looking thoughtfully down at the spot where
the funeral pile of her mother could just be seen.  "I am very
sorry to hear it.  I would rather stay here, where, if I wasn't
born, I've passed my life.  I don't like the settlements - they are
full of wickedness and heart burnings, while God dwells unoffended
in these hills!  I love the trees, and the mountains, and the lake,
and the springs; all that his bounty has given us, and it would
grieve me sorely, Judith, to be forced to quit them.  You are
handsome, and not at all half-witted, and one day you will marry,
and then you will have a husband, and I a brother to take care of
us, if women can't really take care of themselves in such a place
as this."

"Ah!  if this could be so, Hetty, then, indeed, I could now be
a thousand times happier in these woods, than in the settlements.
Once I did not feel thus, but now I do.  Yet where is the man to
turn this beautiful place into such a garden of Eden for us?"

"Harry March loves you, sister," returned poor Hetty, unconsciously
picking the bark off the canoe as she spoke.  "He would be glad
to be your husband, I'm sure, and a stouter and a braver youth is
not to be met with the whole country round."

"Harry March and I understand each other, and no more need be said
about him.  There is one - but no matter.  It is all in the hands
of providence, and we must shortly come to some conclusion about
our future manner of living.  Remain here - that is, remain here,
alone, we cannot - and perhaps no occasion will ever offer for
remaining in the manner you think of.  It is time, too, Hetty, we
should learn all we can concerning our relations and family.  It
is not probable we are altogether without relations, and they may
be glad to see us.  The old chest is now our property, and we have
a right to look into it, and learn all we can by what it holds.
Mother was so very different from Thomas Hutter, that, now I know
we are not his children, I burn with a desire to know whose children
we can be.  There are papers in that chest, I am certain, and those
papers may tell us all about our parents and natural friends."

"Well, Judith, you know best, for you are cleverer than common,
mother always said, and I am only half-witted.  Now father and
mother are dead, I don't much care for any relation but you, and
don't think I could love them I never saw, as well as I ought.  If
you don't like to marry Hurry, I don't see who you can choose for
a husband, and then I fear we shall have to quit the lake, after
all."

"What do you think of Deerslayer, Hetty?" asked Judith, bending
forward like her unsophisticated sister, and endeavoring to
conceal her embarrassment in a similar manner.  "Would he not make
a brother-in-law to your liking?"

"Deerslayer!" repeated the other, looking up in unfeigned surprise.
"Why, Judith, Deerslayer isn't in the least comely, and is altogether
unfit for one like you!"

"He is not ill-looking, Hetty, and beauty in a man is not of much
matter."

"Do you think so, Judith?  I know that beauty is of no great matter,
in man or woman, in the eyes of God, for mother has often told me
so, when she thought I might have been sorry I was not as handsome
as you, though she needn't have been uneasy on that account, for
I never coveted any thing that is yours, sister - but, tell me so
she did - still, beauty is very pleasant to the eye, in both!  I
think, if I were a man, I should pine more for good looks than I do
as a girl.  A handsome man is a more pleasing sight than a handsome
woman."

"Poor child!  You scarce know what you say, or what you mean!
Beauty in our sex is something, but in men, it passes for little.
To be sure, a man ought to be tall, but others are tall, as well as
Hurry; and active - and I think I know those that are more active
- and strong; well, he hasn't all the strength in the world - and
brave - I am certain I can name a youth who is braver!"

"This is strange, Judith!  - I didn't think the earth held a handsomer,
or a stronger, or a more active or a braver man than Hurry Harry!
I'm sure I never met his equal in either of these things."

"Well, well, Hetty - say no more of this.  I dislike to hear you
talking in this manner.  Tis not suitable to your innocence, and
truth, and warm-hearted sincerity.  Let Harry March go.  He quits
us tonight, and no regret of mine will follow him, unless it be
that he has staid so long, and to so little purpose."

"Ah!  Judith; that is what I've long feared - and I did so hope he
might be my brother-in-law!"

"Never mind it now.  Let us talk of our poor mother - and of Thomas
Hutter."

"Speak kindly then, sister, for you can't be quite certain that
spirits don't both hear and see.  If father wasn't father, he was
good to us, and gave us food and shelter.  We can't put any stones
over their graves, here in the water, to tell people all this, and
so we ought to say it with our tongues."

"They will care little for that, girl.  'Tis a great consolation
to know, Hetty, that if mother ever did commit any heavy fault when
young, she lived sincerely to repent of it; no doubt her sins were
forgiven her."

"Tisn't right, Judith, for children to talk of their parents'
sins.  We had better talk of our own."

"Talk of your sins, Hetty!  - If there ever was a creature on earth
without sin, it is you!  I wish I could say, or think the same of
myself; but we shall see.  No one knows what changes affection for
a good husband can make in a woman's heart.  I don't think, child,
I have even now the same love for finery I once had."

"It would be a pity, Judith, if you did think of clothes, over your
parents' graves!  We will never quit this spot, if you say so, and
will let Hurry go where he pleases."

"I am willing enough to consent to the last, but cannot answer for
the first, Hetty.  We must live, in future, as becomes respectable
young women, and cannot remain here, to be the talk and jest of all
the rude and foul tongu'd trappers and hunters that may come upon
the lake.  Let Hurry go by himself, and then I'll find the means
to see Deerslayer, when the future shall be soon settled.  Come,
girl, the sun has set, and the Ark is drifting away from us; let
us paddle up to the scow, and consult with our friends.  This night
I shall look into the chest, and to-morrow shall determine what we
are to do.  As for the Hurons, now we can use our stores without
fear of Thomas Hutter, they will be easily bought off.  Let me get
Deerslayer once out of their hands, and a single hour shall bring
things to an understanding."

Judith spoke with decision, and she spoke with authority, a habit
she had long practised towards her feeble-minded sister.  But,
while thus accustomed to have her way, by the aid of manner and a
readier command of words, Hetty occasionally checked her impetuous
feelings and hasty acts by the aid of those simple moral truths
that were so deeply engrafted in all her own thoughts and feelings;
shining through both with a mild and beautiful lustre that threw
a sort of holy halo around so much of what she both said and did.
On the present occasion, this healthful ascendancy of the girl of
weak intellect, over her of a capacity that, in other situations,
might have become brilliant and admired, was exhibited in the usual
simple and earnest manner.

"You forget, Judith, what has brought us here," she said reproachfully.
"This is mother's grave, and we have just laid the body of father
by her side.  We have done wrong to talk so much of ourselves at
such a spot, and ought now to pray God to forgive us, and ask him
to teach us where we are to go, and what we are to do."

Judith involuntarily laid aside her paddle, while Hetty dropped on
her knees, and was soon lost in her devout but simple petitions.
Her sister did not pray.  This she had long ceased to do directly,
though anguish of spirit frequently wrung from her mental and
hasty appeals to the great source of benevolence, for support, if
not for a change of spirit.  Still she never beheld Hetty on her
knees, that a feeling of tender recollection, as well as of profound
regret at the deadness of her own heart, did not come over her.
Thus had she herself done in childhood, and even down to the hour
of her ill fated visits to the garrisons, and she would willingly
have given worlds, at such moments, to be able to exchange her
present sensations for the confiding faith, those pure aspirations,
and the gentle hope that shone through every lineament and movement
of her otherwise, less favored sister.  All she could do, however,
was to drop her head to her bosom, and assume in her attitude some
of that devotion in which her stubborn spirit refused to unite.
When Hetty rose from her knees, her countenance had a glow and
serenity that rendered a face that was always agreeable, positively
handsome.  Her mind was at peace, and her conscience acquitted her
of a neglect of duty.

"Now, you may go if you want to, Judith," she said, "for God has
been kind to me, and lifted a burden off my heart.  Mother had many
such burdens, she used to tell me, and she always took them off in
this way.  Tis the only way, sister, such things can be done.  You
may raise a stone, or a log, with your hands; but the heart must be
lightened by prayer.  I don't think you pray as often as you used
to do, when younger, Judith!"

"Never mind - never mind, child," answered the other huskily,
"'tis no matter, now.  Mother is gone, and Thomas Hutter is gone,
and the time has come when we must think and act for ourselves."

As the canoe moved slowly away from the place, under the gentle
impulsion of the elder sister's paddle, the younger sat musing,
as was her wont whenever her mind was perplexed by any idea more
abstract and difficult of comprehension than common.

"I don't know what you mean by 'future', Judith," she at length,
suddenly observed.  "Mother used to call Heaven the future, but
you seem to think it means next week, or tomorrow!"

"It means both, dear sister - every thing that is yet to come,
whether in this world or another.  It is a solemn word, Hetty, and
most so, I fear, to them that think the least about it.  Mother's
future is eternity; ours may yet mean what will happen while we
live in this world - Is not that a canoe just passing behind the
castle - here, more in the direction of the point, I mean; it is
hid, now; but certainly I saw a canoe stealing behind the logs!"

"I've seen it some time," Hetty quietly answered, for the Indians
had few terrors for her, "but I didn't think it right to talk about
such things over mother's grave!  The canoe came from the camp,
Judith, and was paddled by a single man.  He seemed to be Deerslayer,
and no Iroquois."

"Deerslayer!" returned the other, with much of her native impetuosity
-"That cannot be!  Deerslayer is a prisoner, and I have been
thinking of the means of setting him free.  Why did you fancy it
Deerslayer, child?"

"You can look for yourself, sister, for there comes the canoe in
sight, again, on this side of the hut."

Sure enough, the light boat had passed the building, and was now
steadily advancing towards the Ark; the persons on board of which
were already collecting in the head of the scow to receive their
visitor.  A single glance sufficed to assure Judith that her sister
was right, and that Deerslayer was alone in the canoe.  His approach
was so calm and leisurely, however, as to fill her with wonder, since
a man who had effected his escape from enemies by either artifice
or violence, would not be apt to move with the steadiness and
deliberation with which his paddle swept the water.  By this time
the day was fairly departing, and objects were already seen dimly
under the shores.  In the broad lake, however, the light still
lingered, and around the immediate scene of the present incidents,
which was less shaded than most of the sheet, being in its broadest
part, it cast a glow that bore some faint resemblance to the warm
tints of an Italian or Grecian sunset.  The logs of the hut and
Ark had a sort of purple hue, blended with the growing obscurity,
and the bark of the hunter's boat was losing its distinctness in
colours richer, but more mellowed, than those it showed under a
bright sun.  As the two canoes approached each other - for Judith and
her sister had plied their paddles so as to intercept the unexpected
visiter ere he reached the Ark - even Deerslayer's sun-burned
countenance wore a brighter aspect than common, under the pleasing
tints that seemed to dance in the atmosphere.  Judith fancied that
delight at meeting her had some share in this unusual and agreeable
expression.  She was not aware that her own beauty appeared to
more advantage than common, from the same natural cause, nor did
she understand what it would have given her so much pleasure to
know, that the young man actually thought her, as she drew nearer,
the loveliest creature of her sex his eyes had ever dwelt on.

"Welcome - welcome, Deerslayer!" exclaimed the girl, as the canoes
floated at each other's side; "we have had a melancholy -a frightful
day - but your return is, at least, one misfortune the less!  Have
the Hurons become more human, and let you go; or have you escaped
from the wretches, by your own courage and skill?"

"Neither, Judith - neither one nor t'other.  The Mingos are Mingos
still, and will live and die Mingos; it is not likely their natur's
will ever undergo much improvement.  Well!  They've their gifts,
and we've our'n, Judith, and it doesn't much become either to
speak ill of what the Lord has created; though, if the truth must
be said, I find it a sore trial to think kindly or to talk kindly
of them vagabonds.  As for outwitting them, that might have been
done, and it was done, too, atween the Sarpent, yonder, and me, when
we were on the trail of Hist -" here the hunter stopped to laugh
in his own silent fashion - "but it's no easy matt
