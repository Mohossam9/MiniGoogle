d
five halls or hostels, each educating its pupils (more or less)
with an especial eye to tutors' fees and other benefices, the
vested rights of the "Dons." Thus all do their best to prevent
the scholars availing themselves of University, as opposed to
Collegiate, lectures; and thus they can stultify a list of some
sixty-six professors. This boarding-school system is simply a
dishonest obstacle to students learning anything which may be of
use to them in after-life, such as modern and Oriental languages,
chemistry, anthropology and the other -ologies. Here in fact men
rarely progress beyond the Trivium and the Quadrivium of the Dark
Ages, and tuition is a fine study of the Res scibilis as
understood by the Admirable Crichton and other worthies, circa
A.D. 1500. The students of Queen Elizabeth's day would here--and
here only--find themselves in congenial company. Worse still,
Oxford is no longer a "Seat of learning" or a "House of the
Muses," nor can learned men be produced under the present system.
The place has become a collection of finishing schools, in fact
little better than a huge board for the examination of big boys
and girls.

Oxford and her education are thoroughly disappointing; but the
sorest point therein is that this sham University satisfies the
hapless Public, which knows nothing about its faineance. It is a
mere stumbling-block in the way of Progress especially barring
the road to one of the main wants of English Education, a great
London University which should not be ashamed to stand by Berlin,
Paris and Vienna.

Had the good knight and "Pious Founder," Sir Thomas Bodley, who
established his library upon the ruins of the University
Bibliotheca wrecked by the "Reformation," been able to foresee
the condition of Oxford and her libraries--Bodleian and
Radcliffean--in this latter section of the XIXth century, he
would hardly, I should hope, have condemned English students and
Continental scholars to compulsory residence and labour in places
so akin to the purgatorial.

   THE THREE UNTRANSLATED TALES IN MR. E. J. W. GIBB'S "FORTY
                            VEZIRS."




                THE THIRTY-EIGHTH VEZIR'S STORY.
             (Page 353 of Mr. Gibb's translation.)



There was in the city of Cairo a merchant, and one day he bought
a slave-girl, and took her to his house. There was in his house
an ape; this the merchant fetched and dragged up to the
slave-girl. He said, "Yield thyself over to this, and I will set
thee free." The slave-girl did so of necessity, and she conceived
by him. When her time was come she bare a son all of whose
members were shaped like those of a man, save that he had a tail
like an ape. The merchant and the slave-girl occupied themselves
bringing up this son. One day, when the son was five or six
months old, the merchant filled a large cauldron with milk, and
lighted a great fire under it. When it was boiling, he seized the
son and cast him into the cauldron; and the girl began to lament.
The merchant said, "Be silent, make no lamentation; go and be
free;" and he gave her some sequins. Then he turned, and the
cauldron had boiled so that not even any bones were left. The
merchant took down the cauldron, and placed seven strainers, one
above the other; and he took the scum that had gathered on the
liquid in the cauldron and filtered it through the seven
strainers, and he took that which was in the last and put it into
a bottle. And the slave-girl bare in her heart bitter hatred
against the merchant, and she said in herself, "Even as thou hast
burned my liver will I burn thee;" and she began to watch her
opportunity. (One day) the merchant said to her, "Make ready some
food," and went out. So the girl cooked the food, and she mixed
some of that poison in the dish. When the merchant returned she
brought the tray and laid it down, and then withdrew into a
corner. The merchant took a spoonful of that food, and as soon as
he put it into his mouth, he knew it to be the poison, and he
cast the spoon that was in his hand at the girl. A piece, of the
bigness of a pea, of that poisoned food fell from the spoon on
the girl's hand, and it made the place where it fell black. As
for the merchant, he turned all black, and swelled till he became
like a blown-out skin, and he died. But the slave-girl medicined
herself and became well; and she kept what remained of the poison
and sold it to those who asked for it.




                  THE FORTIETH VEZIR'S STORY.
             (Page 366 in Mr. Gibb's translation.)



There was of old time a tailor, and he had a fair wife. One day
this woman sent her slave-girl to the carder's to get some cotton
teased. The slave-girl went to the carder's shop and gave him
cotton for a gown to get teased. The carder while teasing the
cotton displayed his yard to the slave-girl. She blushed and
passed to his other side. As she thus turned round the carder
displayed his yard on that side also. Thus the slave-girl saw it
on that side too. And she went and said to her mistress, "Yon
carder, to whom I went, has two yards." The lady said to her, "Go
and say to yon carder, 'My mistress wishes thee; come at night.'"
So the slave-girl went and said this to the carder. As soon as it
was night the carder went to that place and waited. The woman
went out and met the carder and said, "Come and have to do with
me while I am lying by my husband." When it was midnight the
carder came and waked the woman. The woman lay conveniently and
the carder fell to work. She felt that the yard which entered her
was but one, and said, "Ah my soul, carder, at it with both of
them." While she was softly speaking her husband awaked and
asked, "What means thy saying, 'At it with both of them?'" He
stretched out his hand to his wife's kaze and the carder's yard
came into it. The carder drew himself back and his yard slipped
out of the fellow's hand, and he made shift to get away. The
fellow said, "Out on thee, wife, what meant that saying of thine,
'At it with both of them?'" The woman said, "O husband, I saw in
my dream that thou wast fallen into the sea and wast swimming
with one hand and crying out, 'Help! I am drowning!' I shouted to
thee from the shore, 'At it with both of them,' and thou
begannest to swim with both thy hands." Then the husband said,
"Wife, I too know that I was in the sea, from this that a wet
fish came into my hand and then slipped out and escaped; thou
speakest truly." And he loved his wife more than before.




                THE LADY'S THIRTY-FOURTH STORY.
                  (From the India Office MS.)
             (Page 399 in Mr. Gibb's translation.)



They tell that there was a Khoja and he had an exceeding fair
son, who was so beautiful that he who looked upon him was
confounded. This Khoja watched over his son right carefully; he
let him not come forth from a certain private chamber, and he
left not the ribbon of his trousers unsealed. When the call to
prayer was chanted from the minaret, the boy would ask his father
saying, "Why do they cry out thus?" and the Khoja would answer,
"Someone has been undone and has died, and they are calling out
to bury him." And the boy believed these words. The beauty of
this boy was spoken of in Persia; and a Khoja came from Persia to
Baghdad with his goods and chattels for the love of this boy. And
he struck up a friendship with the boy's father, and ever gave to
him his merchandise at an easy price, and he sought to find out
where his son abode. When the Khoja had discovered that the boy
was kept safe in that private chamber, he one day said to his
father, "I am about to go to a certain place; and I have a chest
whereinto I have put whatsoever I possess of valuables; this I
shall send to thee, and do thou take it and shut it up in that
chamber where thy son is." And the father answered, "Right
gladly." So the Khoja let build a chest so large that he himself
might lie in it, and he put therein wine and all things needful
for a carouse. Then he said to his servant, "Go, fetch a porter
and take this chest to the house of Khoja Such-an-one, and say,
'My master has sent this to remain in your charge,' and leave it
and come away. And again on the morrow go and fetch it, saying,
'My master wishes the chest.'" So the servant went for a porter,
and the Khoja hid himself in the chest. Then the boy laded the
porter with the chest and took it to the other Khoja's house,
where he left it and went away. When it was night the Khoja came
forth from the chest, and he saw a moon-face sleeping in the
bed-clothes, and a candle was burning in a candlestick at his
head; and when the Khoja beheld this he was confounded and
exclaimed, "And blessed be God, the fairest of Creators!"[FN#426]
Then the Khoja laid out the wine and so forth; and he went up
softly and waked the boy. And the boy arose from his place and
addressed himself to speak, saying, "Wherefore hast thou come
here?" Straight-way the Khoja filled a cup and gave it to him,
saying, "Drink this, and then I shall tell thee what manner of
man I am." And he besought the boy and spread out sequins before
him. So the boy took the cup and drank what was in it. When the
Khoja had given him to drink three or four cups the face of the
boy grew tulip-hued, and he became heated with the wine and began
to sport with the Khoja. So all that night till morning did the
Khoja make merry with the boy; and whatsoever his desire was, he
attained thereto. When it was morning, the Khoja again went into
the chest; and the servant came and laded the porter with the
same and took it back to his house. And on the morrow, when the
boy and his father were sitting together, the mu'ezzin chanted
the call to prayer, whereupon the boy exclaimed, "Out on thee,
father; and the boy who is undone dies, and so this fellow goes
up there and bawls out; last night they undid me; how is it that
I am not dead?" Then the father smote the boy on the mouth and
said, "Speak not such words; they are a shame." And then he knew
why the chest had come.







                   Arabian Nights, Volume 14
                           Footnotes



[FN#1]  From the Wortley Montague MS. vol. iii. pp. 80-96. J.
Scott: vol. vi. pp. 1-7. Histoire du Sulthan d'Yemen et de ses
trots fils; Gauttier vol. vi. pp. 158-165.

[FN#2]  The worst disease in human life, now recognised as "Annus
Domini."

[FN#3]  Arab. "Mal wa Ghawal": in Badawi parlance "Mal"
would=flocks and herds (pecunia, pecus); and amongst the
burghers=ready money, coin. Another favourite jingle of similar
import is "Mal wa Nawal."

There is an older form of the Sultan of Al Yaman and his three
sons, to be found in M. Zotenberg's "Chronique de Tabari," vol.
ii. pp. 357-61.

[FN#4]  In the W. M. MS. the sisters are called "Shahrzadeh"
(=City born) and "Dinarzadeh" (=ducat born) and the royal
brothers Shahrbaz (=City player or City falcon) and Kahraman
(vol. i. p. 1) alias Samarban (ibid.). I shall retain the old
spelling.

[FN#5]  I have hitherto translated "wa adraka (masc.) Shahrazada
al-Sabah," as=And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day; but it is
more correct as well as more picturesque to render the phrase
"was surprised (or overtaken) by the dawn."

[FN#6]  Arab. "'Adran,"=much and heavy rain.

[FN#7]  For "Halwa" see vol. ii. pp. 47-212. Scott (vol. vi. 413)
explains "Hamiz" as "a species of small grain," probably
confounding it with Hummus (or Himmis)=vetches. It is the pop.
term for pickles, "sour meat" as opposed to "sweetmeats." The
Arabs divide the camel's pasture into "Khullah" which means sweet
food called bread and into "Hamiz" termed fruit: the latter is
composed mainly of salsolaceae, and as camels feed upon it during
the hot season it makes them drink. Hence in Al Hariri (Preface)
"I change the pasture," i.e., I pass from grave to gay, from
light to dignified style. (Chenery, p. 274).

[FN#8]  This is the modern version of the tale which the author
of "Zadig" has made familiar to Europe. The hero is brought
before the King and Queen of Babylon for stealing a horse and a
dog; and, when held by the chief "Destour" (priest) to be a
thief, justifies himself. I have given in full the older history
from Tabari, the historian (vixit A.D. 839-923). For the tracker
("Paggi") and the art of tracking see Sind Revisited, i. 180-183.
I must again express my wonder that the rural police of Europe
still disdain the services of trained dogs when these are about
to be introduced into the army.

[FN#9]  Arab. "Bita'i"=my own. I have already noticed that this
is the Egypt. form and the Nilotes often turn the 'Ayn into an H,
e.g. Bitaht for Bita'at, e.g. Ash Shabakah bitaht as-Sayd, thy
net for fishing. (Spitta Bey, Contes Arabes Modernes, p. 43.)

[FN#10]  Arab. "Mukabbab;" prop. vaulted, arched, domed in Kubbah
(or cupola)-shape.

[FN#11]  Arab. "Firasah." "Sciences are of three kinds: one the
science of Faith, another the science of Physiognomy (Firasah),
and another the science of the Body; but unless there be the
science of Physiognomy, other science availeth not." So says "The
Forty Vizirs:" Lady's vith story and Vizir's xxxist story. For a
note on "Firasah" see vol. viii. 326.

[FN#12]  Arab. "In lam tazidd Kayni"=lit. unless thou oppose my
forming or composition.

[FN#13]  Arab. "Farafish," a word which I cannot find in the
dictionary, and so translate according to the context. Dr.
Steingass remarks that the nearest approach to it would be
"Farafik" (plur. of Furfak)=fine, thin or soft bread.

[FN#14]  See, in the "Turkish Tales" by Petis de la Croix (Weber,
Tales of the East, vol. iii. 196), the History of the Sophi of
Baghdad, where everything returns to (or resembles) its origin.
Thus the Wazir who proposed to cut up a criminal and hang him in
the shambles was the self-convicted son of a butcher; he who
advised boiling him down and giving his flesh to the dogs was the
issue of a cook, and the third who proposed to pardon him was
nobly born. See Night cccxli.

[FN#15]  Arab. "Al-Mafyaat," lit.=a shady place; a locality
whereupon the sun does not rise.

[FN#16]  Arab. "Ja'idiyah," a favourite word in this MS.
"Ja'ad"=a curl, a liberal man: Ja'ad al-yad=miserly, and Abu
ja'dah=father of curls,=a wolf. Scott (passim) translates the
word "Sharper;" Gore Ouseley "Labourer;" and De Sacy
(Chrestomathie ii. 369, who derives it from Ju'd=avoir les
cheveux crepus): in Egypt, homme de la populace, canaille. He
finds it in the Fabrica Linguae Arab. of Germanus of Silesia (p.
786)=ignavis, hebes, stupidus, esp. a coward. Ibrahim Salamah of
Alexandria makes the term signify in Syria, impudent, thieving,
wicked. Spitta Bey translates this word musicien ambulant in his
Gloss. to Contes Arabes, p. 171. According to Dr. Steingass, who,
with the Muhit al-Muhit, reads "Ju'aydiyah," Ju'ayd is said to be
the P. N. of an Egyptian clown, who, with bell-hung cap and
tambourine in hand, wandered about the streets singing laudatory
doggrel and pestering the folk for money. Many vagabonds who
adopted this calling were named after him and the word was
generalised in that sense.

[FN#17] MS. vol. iii. pp. 96-121. Scott, "Story of the Three
Sharpers and the Sultan," pp. 7-17; Gauttier, Histoire des trois
filous et d'un Sulthan, vi. 165-176. 

[FN#18] Arab. Yasrahu=roaming, especially at early dawn; hence
the wolf is called "Sirhan," and Yaklishu (if I read it aright)
is from Kulsh, and equivalent to "kicking" (their heels). 

[FN#19] Nusf=half a dirham, drachma or franc, see ii. 37; vi.
214, etc. 

[FN#20] Bast, a preparation of Bhang (Cannabis Sativa), known in
Egypt but not elsewhere: see Lane, M. E., chapt. xv. Here it is
made synonymous with "Hashish"=Bhang in general. 

[FN#21] Ghaushah, a Persianism for which "Ghaugha" is a more
common form. "Ghaush" is a tree of hard wood whereof musical
instruments were made; hence the mod. words "Ghasha" and
"Ghawwasha"=he produced a sound, and "Ghaushah"=tumult, quarrel.
According to Dr. Steingass, the synon. in the native dicts. are
"Khisam," "Lag-hat," "Jalabah," etc. 

[FN#22] Said ironice, the jeweller being held to be one of the
dishonest classes, like the washerman, the water-carrier, the
gardener, etc. In England we may find his representative in the
"silversmith," who will ask a pound sterling for a bit of metal
which cost him perhaps five shillings or even less, and who hates
to be bought by weight. The Arab. has "Jauhar-ji," a Turkish form
for Jauhari; and here "jauhar" apparently means a pearl, the
stone once peculiar to royalty in Persia, but the kind of gem is
left undetermined. 

[FN#23] Arab. "Saza, yasizu," not a dictionary word. Perhaps it
is a clerical error for "Sasa," he groomed or broke in a horse,
hence understood all about horses. 

[FN#24] In the orig. "Shorbah," Pers.=a mess of pottage: I have
altered it for reasons which will presently appear. 

[FN#25] Arab. "Ghabasah," from Ghabas=obscure, dust-coloured. 

[FN#26] Arab. "Susah"=a weevil, a moth, a worm. It does not mean
simply a flaw, but a live animal (like our toads in the rock);
and in the popular version of the tale the lapidary discovers its
presence by the stone warming in his hand. 

[FN#27] Arab. "Masha'ili" the cresset-bearer who acted hangman:
see vol. i. 259, etc. 

[FN#28] Arab. "Ta'kil," tying up a camel's foreleg above the
knee; the primary meaning of Akl, which has so many secondary
significations. 

[FN#29] Arab. "Suwan," lit.=rock, syenite, hard stone, flint;
here a marteau de guerre. 

[FN#30] Arab. "Halik"=intensely black, so as to look blue under a
certain angle of light. 

[FN#31] Arab. "Rikab" (=stirrup) + "dar" Pers. (=holder). 

[FN#32] I have ransacked dictionaries and vocabularies but the
word is a mere blank. 

[FN#33] Arab. "Jamusah." These mules are believed in by the
Arabs. Shaw and other travellers mention the Mauritanian
"Jumart," the breed between a bull and a mare (or jennyass) or an
ass and a cow. Buffon disbelieved in the mongrel, holding it to
be a mere bardeau, got by a stallion horse out of an ass.
Voltaire writes "Jumarre" after German fashion and Littre derives
it from jument + art (finale pejorative), or the Languedoc
"Gimere" which according to Diez suggests "Chimaera." Even in
London not many years ago a mule was exhibited as the issue of a
horse and a stag. No Indian ever allows his colt to drink
buffalo's milk, the idea being that a horse so fed will lie down
in instead of fording or swimming a stream. 

[FN#34] See Sindbad the Seaman, vol. vi. 9. 

[FN#35] Arab. "Mubattat" from batt=a duck: in Persia the
Batt-i-May is a wine-glass shaped like the duck. Scott (vi. 12)
translates "thick and longish." 

[FN#36] Arab. "his Harim"; see vol. i. 165; iv. 126. VOL. XIV. 

[FN#37] Again "he" for she. See vol. ii. 179. 

[FN#38] Arab. "Ghaziyah": for the plur. "Ghawazi" see vol. i.
214; also Lane (M.E.) index under "Ghazeeyehs." 

[FN#39] The figure prothesis without apodosis. Understand "will
slay thee": see vol. vi. 203. 

[FN#40] Because the girl had not been a professional dancer, i.e
a public prostitute. 

[FN#41] Arab. "Aman"=quarter, mercy: see vol. i. 342. 

[FN#42] For the "Mandil" of mercy see vol. i. 343; for that of
dismissal x. 47 and Ibn Khall. iv. 211. In Spitta Bey's "Contes
Arabes" (p. 223), I find throwing the kerchief (taramma al
mahramah) used in the old form of choosing a mate. In the Tale of
the Sultan of AlYaman and his three Sons (Supplem. Nights, vol.
iv.) the Princesses drop their kerchiefs upon the head of the
Prince who had saved them, by way of pointing him out. 

[FN#43] Arab. "Sattar:" see vols. i. 258 and iii. 41. 

[FN#44] In the text "Argha" for "Arkha"=he "brayed" (like an
ostrich, etc.) for "his limbs relaxed." It reminds one of the
German missionary's fond address to his flock, "My prethren, let
us bray!" 

[FN#45] Arab. "Azbad," from Zbd (Zabd)=foaming, frothing, etc.,
whence "Zubaydah," etc. 

[FN#46] Arab. "Zabh" (Zbh)=the ceremonial killing of animals for
food: see vols. v. 391; viii. 44. I may note, as a proof of how
modern is the civilisation of Europe that the domestic fowl was
unknown to Europe till about the time of Pericles (ob. B.C. 429). 

[FN#47] See in "The Forty Vizirs" (Lady's ivth Tale) how Khizr
tells the King the origin of his Ministers from the several
punishments which they propose for the poor man. I have noticed
this before in Night cccxxxiii. Boethius, translated by Chaucer,
explains the underlying idea, "All thynges seken ayen to hir
propre course and all thynges rejoysen in hir returninge agayne
to hir nature." 

[FN#48] For the Taylasan hood see vol. iv. 286. 

[FN#49] The "Kalansuwah"-cap is noted by Lane (A. N. chapt. iii.
22) as "Kalensuweh." In M. E. (Supplement i. "The Copts") he
alters the word to Kalas'weh and describes it as a strip of
woollen stuff, of a deep blue or black colour, about four inches
wide, attached beneath the turban and hanging down the back to
the length of about a foot. It is the distinguishing mark of the
Coptic regular clergy.

[FN#50] W. M. MS. vol. iii. pp. 121-141. Scott, "The Adventures
of the abdicated Sultan," pp. 18-19; including the "History of
Mahummud, Sultan of Cairo," pp. 20-30. 

[FN#51] "Kahirah." I repeat my belief (Pilgrimage i. 171) that
"Kahirah," whence our "Cairo" through the Italian corruption,
means not la victorieuse (Mediant al-Kahirah) as D'Herbelot has
it; but City of Kahir or Mars the planet. It was so called
because as Richardson informed the world (sub voce) it was
founded in A.H. 358 (=A.D. 968) when the warlike planet was in
the ascendant by the famous General Jauhar a Dalmatian renegade
(not a "Greek slave") for the first of the Fatimite dynasty
Al-Mu'izz li 'l-dini 'llah. 

[FN#52] According to Caussin de Perceval (pere) in his
translation of the "Contes Arabes," there are four wonders in the
Moslem world: (1) the Pharos of Alexandria; (2) the Bridge of
Sanjia in Northern Syria; (3) The Church of Rohab (Edessa); and
(4) the Amawi Mosque of Damascus. 

[FN#53] Arab. "Faddah," lit.=silver, because made of copper
alloyed with nobler metal; the smallest Egyptian coin=Nuss (i.e.
Nusf, or half a dirham) and the Turk. parah. It is the fortieth
of the piastre and may be assumed at the value of a
quarter-farthing. 

[FN#54] This word, in Egypt. "Harag," is the cry with which the
Dallal (broker) announces each sum bidden at an auction. 

[FN#55] The Portuguese Xerafim: Supplemental Nights, vol. iii.
166. 

[FN#56] A Khan or caravanserai: see vol. i. 266 and Pilgrimage i.
60. 

[FN#57] Arab. "Hilm" (vision) "au 'Ilm" (knowledge) a phrase
peculiar to this MS. 

[FN#58] The careless scribe forgets that the Sultan is speaking
and here drops into the third person. This "Enallage of persons"
is, however, Koranic and therefore classical: Arab critics aver
that in such cases the "Hikayah" (=literal reproduction of a
discourse, etc.) passes into an "Ikhbar"=mere account of the same
discourse). See Al Mas'udi iii. 216. I dare not reproduce this
figure in English. 

[FN#50] Arab. "Auzah," the Pers. Otak and the Turk. Otah (vulg.
"Oda" whence "Odalisque"), a popular word in Egypt and Syria. 

[FN#60] Arab. "Al Afandiyah" showing the late date or reduction
of the tale. The Turkish word derives from the Romaic Afentis
({Greek}) the corrupted O.G.{Greek}=an absolute commander, and
"authentie." The word should not be written as usual "Effendi,"
but "Efendi," as Prof. Galland has been careful to do. 

[FN#61] Arab. "Al-dakhlah"; repeatedly referred to in The Nights.
The adventure is a replica of that in "Abu Mohammed highs
Lazybones," vol. iv., pp. 171-174. 

[FN#62] Usual in the East, not in England, where some mothers are
idiots enough not to tell their daughters what to expect on the
wedding night. Hence too often unpleasant surprises, disgust and
dislike. The most modern form is that of the chloroform'd bride
upon whose pillow the bridegroom found a paper pinned and
containing the words, "Mamma says you're to do what you like." 

[FN#63] Arab. "Akhaztu dam wajhhi ha." 

[FN#64] Arab. "Dilk" more commonly "Khirkah," the tattered and
pieced robe of a religious mendicant. 

[FN#65] Arab. "Darbalah." Scott (p. 24) must have read
"Gharbalah" when he translated "A turban full of holes as a
sieve." In classical Arabic the word is written "Darbalah," and
seems to correspond with the Egyptian "Darabukkah," a tabor of
wood or earthenware figured by Lane (M.E. chapt. xviii.). It is,
like the bowl, part of the regular Darwaysh's begging gear. 

[FN#66] Vulg. Maghribi. For this word see the story of Alaeddin,
Supplem., vol. iii. 31. According to Heron, "History of
Maugraby," the people of Provence, Languedoc and Gascony use
Maugraby as a term of cursing: Maugrebleu being used in other
parts of France. 

[FN#67] In text "Fanarat"; the Arab. plur. of the Pers. "Fanar"=a
light-house, and here equiv. to the Mod. Gr. {Greek}, a lantern,
the Egypt. "Fanus." 

[FN#68] This Sultan of the Jann preceded by sweepers,
flag-bearers and tent-pitchers always appears in the form of
second-sight called by Egyptians "Darb al Mandal"=striking the
magic circle in which the enchanter sits when he conjures up
spirits. Lane (M. E. chapt. xii.) first made the "Cairo Magician"
famous in Europe, but Herklots and others had described a cognate
practice in India many years before him. 

[FN#69] Arab, "Jawush" for Chawush (vulg. Chiaush) Turk.=an army
serjeant, a herald or serjeant at arms; an apparitor or officer
of the Court of Chancery (not a "Mace-bearer or Messenger,"
Scott). See vol. vii. 327. 

[FN#70] Arab. from Persian "Bimaristan," a "sick-house,"
hospital, a mad-house: see vol. i. 288. 

[FN#71] The text says only that "he was reading:" sub. the Holy
Volume.

[FN#72] MS. vol. iii., pp. 142-168. Scott, "Story of the First
Lunatic," pp. 31 44. Gauttier, Histoire du Premier Fou, vol. vi.
187. It is identical with No. ii. of Chavis and Cazotte,
translated by C. de Perceval, Le Bimaristan (i.e. the Hospital),
ou Histoire du jeune Marchand de Bagdad et de la Dame inconnue
(vol. viii. pp. 179-180). Heron terms it the "Story of Halechalbe
(Ali Chelebi?) and the Unknown Lady," and the narrative is
provided with a host of insipid and incorrect details, such as "A
gentleman enjoying his pipe." The motif of this tale is common in
Arab. folk lore, and it first appears in the "Tale of Aziz and
Azizah," ii. 328. A third variant will occur further on. 

[FN#73] Spelt in vol. iii. 143 and elsewhere, "Khwaja" for
"Khwajah." 

[FN#74] Arab. "Hubban li-raasik,"=out of love for thy head, i.e.
from affection for thee. Dr. Steingass finds it analogous with
the Koranic "Hubban li 'llahi" (ii. 160), where it is joined with
"Ashaddu"=stronger, as regards love to or for Allah, more Allah
loving. But it can stand adverbially by itself=out of love for
Allah, for Allah's sake. 

[FN#75] Arab. "Zahr," lit. and generically a blossom; but often
used in a specific sense throughout The Nights. 

[FN#76] Arab. "Kursi" here=a square wooden seat without back and
used for sitting cross-legged. See Suppl. vol. i. 9. 

[FN#77] Arab. "Sujjadah"=lit. a praying carpet, which Lane calls
"Seggadeh." 

[FN#78] Arab. "Wakil," lit.=agent: here the woman's
representative, corresponding roughly with the man who gives away
the bride amongst ourselves. 

[FN#79] The mention of coffee and sherbet, here and in the next
page, makes the tale synchronous with that of Ma'aruf or the
xviith. century. 

[FN#80] The MS. writes "Zardakat" for "Zardakhan": see below. 

[FN#81] Scott (p. 36) has "mahazzim (for mahazim), al Zerdukkaut
(for al-Zardakhan)" and "munnaskif (for manashif) al fillfillee."
Of the former he notes (p. 414) "What this composition is I
cannot define: it may be translated compound of saffron, yoke of
egg or of yellowish drugs." He evidently confounds it with the
Pers. Zard-i-Khayah=yoke of egg. Of the second he says "compound
of peppers, red, white and black." Lane (The Nights, vol. i. p.
8) is somewhat scandalised at such misrepresentation, translating
the first "apron-napkins of thick silk," and the second "drying
towels of Lif or palm-fibre," further suggesting that the text
may have dropped a conjunction=drying towels and fibre. 

[FN#82] Arab. "Liwan al-barrani," lit.=the outer bench in the
"Maslahk" or apodyterium. 

[FN#83] Arab. "Ma'jun," pop. applied to an electuary of Bhang
(Cannabis sativa): it is the "Maagoon" sold by the "Maagungee" of
Lane (M.E. chapt. xv.). Here, however, the term may be used in
the sense of "confections" generally, the sweetmeats eaten by way
of restoratives in the Bath. 

[FN#84] He speaks of taking her maidenhead as if it were porter's
work and so defloration was regarded by many ancient peoples. The
old Nilotes incised the hymen before congress; the Phoenicians,
according to Saint Athanasius, made a slave of the husband's
abate it. The American Chibchas and Caribs looked upon virginity
as a reproach, proving that the maiden had never inspired love.
For these and other examples see p. 72, chap. iii. "L'Amour dans
l'Humanite," by P. Mantegazza, a civilised and unprejudiced
traveller. 

[FN#85] Arab. "Zill," lit. "shadow me." 

[FN#86] Arab. "Istinshak," one of the items of the "Wuzu" or
lesser ablution: see vol. v. 198. 

[FN#87] In Chavis her name is "Zaliza" and she had "conceived an
unhappy passion" for her master, to whom she "declared her
sentiments without reserve." 

[FN#88] Arab. "Armaghanat," the Arab. plur. of "Armaghan,"
Pers.=a present. 

[FN#89] In the text, "jumlatun min al-mal," which Scott
apparently reads "Hamlat al-jamal" and translates (p. 38) "a
camel's load of treasure." 

[FN#90] The learned man was to exorcise some possible "evil
spirit" or "the eye," a superstition which seems to have begun,
like all others, with the ancient Egyptians. 

[FN#91] The MS., I have said, always writes "Khwaja" instead of
"Khwajah" (plur. "Khwajat"): for this word, the modern Egyptian
"Howajah," see vol. vi. 46. Here it corresponds with our
"goodman." 

[FN#92] Arab. "Yatazawadu"=increasing. 

[FN#93] By which she accepted the offer. 

[FN#94] This incident has already occurred in the tale of the
Portress (Second Lady of Baghdad, vol. i. 179), but here the
consequences are not so tragical. In Chavis the vulgar cock
becomes "a golden Censer ornamented with diamonds, to be sold for
two thousand sequins" (each=9 shill.). 

[FN#95] A royal sign of wrath generally denoting torture and
death. See vols. iv. 72; vi. 250. 

[FN#96] Arab. "Ya Sallam," addressed to Allah. 

[FN#97] Here more is meant than meets the eye. When a Moslem's
head was struck off, in the days of the Caliphate, it was placed
under his armpit, whereas that of a Jew or a Christian was set
between his legs, close to the seat of dishonour. 

[FN#98] In Chavis and Cazotte the lady calls to "Morigen, her
first eunuch, and says, Cut off his head!" Then she takes a
theorbo and "composed the following couplets"--of which the first
may suffice:

          Since my swain unfaithful proves,
          Let him go to her he loves, etc., etc. 

[FN#99] The device has already occurred in "Ali Baba." 

[FN#100] Arab. "Al-ma'hud min ghayr wa'd."

[FN#101] In Chavis and Cazotte the king is Harun al-Rashid and
the masterfl young person proves to be Zeraida, the favourite
daughter of Ja'afar Bermaki; whilst the go-between is not the
young lady's mother but Nemana, an old governess.  The over-
jealous husband in the Second Lady of Baghdad (vol. i. 179) is
Al-Amin, son and heir of the Caliph Marun al-Rashid.

[FN#102] Vol. iii. pp. 168-179: and Scott's "Story of the Second
Lunatic," pp. 45-51. The name is absurdly given as the youth was
anything but a lunatic; but this is Arab symmetromania. The tale
is virtually the same as "Women's Wiles," in Supplemental Nights,
vol. ii. 99-107. 

[FN#103] This forward movement on the part of the fair one is
held to be very insulting by the modest Moslem. This incident is
wanting in "Women's Wiles." 

[FN#104] Arab. "Labbah," usually the part of the throat where
ornaments are hung or camels are stabbed. 

[FN#105] The chief of the Moslem Church. For the origin of the
office and its date (A.D. 1453) see vols. ix. 289, and x. 81. 

[FN#106] Arab. "Satihah"=a she-Satih: this seer was a headless
and neckless body, with face in breast, lacking members and lying
prostrate on the ground. His fellow, "Shikk," was a half-man, and
both foretold the divine mission of Mohammed. (Ibn Khall. i.
487.) 

[FN#107] Arab. "Wakt al-Zuha;" the division of time between
sunrise and midday. 

[FN#108] In the text "Sufrah"=the cloth: see vol. i. 178, etc. 

[FN#109] Arab. "Ya Tinjir," lit.=O Kettle. 

[FN#110] Arab. "Tari," lit.=wet, with its concomitant suggestion,
soft and pleasant like desert-rain. 

[FN#111] Here meaning "Haste, haste!" See vol. i. 46. 

[FN#112] The chief man (Agha) of the Gypsies, the Jink of Egypt
whom Turkish soldiers call Ghiovende, a race of singers and
dancers; in fact professional Nautch-girls. See p. 222, "Account
of the Gypsies of India," by David MacRitchie (London, K. Paul,
1886), a most useful manual. 

[FN#113] Arab. "Kurush," plur of. "Kirsh" (pron. "Girsh"), the
Egyptian piastre=one-fifth of a shilling. The word may derive
from Karsh=collecting money; but it is more probably a corruption
of Groschen, primarily a great or thick piece of money and
secondarily a small silver coin=3 kreuzers=1 penny. 

[FN#114] The purse ("Kis") is=500 piastres (kurush)=œ5; and a
thousand purses compose the Treasury ("Khaznah")=œ5,000.

[FN#115] MS. vol. iii. pp. 179-303. It is Scott's "Story of the
Retired Sage and his Pupil, related to the Sultan by the Second
Lunatic," vi. pp. 52-67; and Gauttier's Histoire du Sage, vi.
199-2l4. The scene is laid in Cairo.

[FN#116] Meaning that he was an orphan and had, like the
well-known widow, "seen better days."

[FN#117] The phrase, I have noted, is not merely pleonastic: it
emphasises the assertion that it was a chance day.

[FN#118] An old Plinian fable long current throughout the East.
It is the Pers. Nim-chihreh, and the Arab Shikk and possibly
Nasnas=nisf al-Nas (?) See vol. v. 333. Shikk had received from
Allah only half the form of a man, and his rival diviner Satih
was a shapeless man of flesh without limbs. They lived in the
days of a woman named Tarifah, daughter of Al-Khayr al-Himyari
and wife of Amru bin 'Amir who was famous for having intercourse
with the Jann. When about to die she sent for the two, on account
of their deformity and the influence exercised upon them by the
demons; and, having spat into their mouths, bequeathed to them
her Jinni, after which she departed life and was buried at
Al-Johfah. Presently they became noted soothsayers; Shikk had
issue but Satih none; they lived 300 (some say 600) years, and
both died shortly before the birth of the Prophet concerning whom
they prophesied. When the Tobba of Al-Yaman dreamed that a dove
flew from a holy place and settled in the Tihamah
(lowland-seaboard) of Meccah, Satih interpreted it to signify
that a Prophet would arise to destroy idols and to teach the best
of faiths. The two also predicted (according to Tabari) to
Al-Rabi'ah, son of Nasr, a Jewish king of Al-yaman, that the
Habash (Abyssinians) should conquer the country, govern it, and
be expelled, and after this a Prophet should arise amongst the
Arabs and bring a new religion which all should embrace and which
should endure until Doomsday. Compare this with the divining
damsel in Acts xvi. 16-18.

[FN#119] Arab. "Kahramanah;" the word has before been explained
as a nurse, a duenna, an Amazon guarding the Harem. According to
C. de Perceval (pere) it was also the title given by the
Abbasides to the Governess of the Serraglio.

[FN#120] So in the Apocrypha ("Tobias" vi. 8). Tobit is taught by
the Archangel Raphael to drive away evil spirits (or devils) by
the smoke of a bit of fish's heart. The practice may date from
the earliest days when "Evil Spirits" were created by man. In
India, when Europeans deride the existence of Jinns and
Rakshasas, and declare that they never saw one, the people
receive this information with a smile which means only, "I should
think not! you and yours are worse than any of our devils."

[FN#121] An Inquisitorial costume called in the text "Shamiyat bi
al-Nar."

[FN#122] A tribe of the Jinn sometimes made synonymous with
"Marid" and at other times contrasted with these rebels, as in
the Story of Ma'aruf and J. Scott's "History of the Sultan of
Hind" (vol. vi. 195). For another note see The Nights, iv. 88.

[FN#123] Arab. "'Ilm al-Huruf," not to be confounded with the
"'Ilm al-Jumal," or "Hisab Al-Jumal," a notation by numerical
values of the alphabet. See Lumsden's Grammar of the Persian
Language, i. 37.

[FN#124] Like our "Cut your mutton," or manger la soupe or die
suppe einzunehmen. For this formula meaning like the Brazilian
"cup of water," a grand feast, see vol. vii. 168.

[FN#125] Arab. "Tafazzal," a most useful word employed upon
almost all occasions of invitation and mostly equivalent to "Have
the kindness," etc. See vol. ii. 103.

[FN#126] The Shaykh for humility sits at the side, not at the
"Sadr," or top of the room; but he does not rise before the
temporal power. The Sultan is equally courteous and the Shaykh
honours him by not keeping silence.

[FN#127] Arab. "Miat Mamluk kitabi," the latter word meaning "one
of the Book, a Jew" (especially), or a Christian.

[FN#128] This MS. prefers the rare form "Al-Jann" for the
singular.

[FN#129] These flags, I have noticed, are an unfailing
accompaniment of a Jinn army.

[FN#130] MS. vol. iii. pp. 203-210; Scott, "Night Adventure of
the Sultan," pp. 68-71. Gauttier, Aventure nocturne du Sulthan,
vi. 214.

[FN#131] Arab. "Mashrut shadak." Ashdak is usually applied to a
wide-chapped face, like that of Margaret Maultasch or
Mickle-mouthed Meg. Here, however, it alludes to an accidental
deformity which will presently be described.

[FN#132] Arab. "Amsik lisana-k": the former word is a standing
"chaff" with the Turks, as in their tongue it means cunnus-penis
and nothing else. I ever found it advisable when speaking Arabic
before Osmanlis, to use some such equivalent as Khuz=take thou.

[FN#133] This is the familiar incident in "Ali Baba": Supplem.
vol iii. 231, etc.

[FN#134] MS. iii. 210-214. Scott's "Story of the broken-backed
Schoolmaster," vi. pp. 72-75, and Gauttier's "Histoire du Maitre
d'ecole ereinte," vi. 217. The Arabic is "Muaddib al-Atfal"=one
who teacheth children. I have before noted that amongst Moslems
the Schoolmaster is always a fool. So in Europe of the 16th
century probably no less than one-third of the current jests
turned upon the Romish clergy and its phenomenal ignorance
compared with that of the pagan augur. The Story of the First
Schoolmaster is one of the most humorous in this MS.

[FN#135] For the usual ceremony when a Moslem sneezes, see vol.
ix. 220.

[FN#136] The "day in the country," lately become such a favourite
with English schools, is an old Eastern custom.

[FN#137] MS. iii. 214-219. Scott's "Story of the wry-mouthed
Schoolmaster," vi. pp. 74-75: Gauttier's Histoire du Second
Estropie, vi. p. 220.

[FN#138] In these days the whole would be about 10d.

[FN#139] Pay-day for the boys in Egypt. The Moslem school has
often been described but it always attracts the curiosity of
strangers. The Moorish or Maroccan variety is a simple affair;
"no forms, no desks, few books. A number of boards about the size
of foolscap, whitewashed on either side, whereon the
lessons--from the alphabet to sentences of the Koran--are plainly
written in large black letters; a pen and ink, a book and a
switch or two, complete the paraphernalia. The dominie, squatting
on the ground, tailor-fashion, like his pupils, who may number
from ten to thirty, repeats the lesson in a sonorous singsong
voice, and is imitated by the urchins, who accompany their voices
by a rocking to and fro which sometimes enables them to keep
time. A sharp application of the cane is wonderfully effectual in
recalling wandering attention; and lazy boys are speedily
expelled. On the admission of a pupil, the parents pay some small
sum, varying according to their means, and every Wednesday, which
is a half-holiday, a payment is made from 1/4d. to 2d. New moons
and feasts are made occasions for larger payments, and are also
holidays, which last ten days during the two greater festivals.
Thursdays are whole holidays, and no work is done on Friday
mornings, that day being the Mohammedan 'Sabbath,' or at least
'meeting day,' as it is called. When the pupils have mastered the
first short chapter of the Koran, it is customary for them to be
paraded round the town on horseback, with ear-splitting music,
and sometimes charitably disposed persons make small presents to
the youngster by way of encouragement. After the first, the last
is learned, then the last but one, and so on, backwards, as, with
the exception of the first, the longest chapters are at the
beginning. Though reading and a little writing are taught, at the
same time, all the scholars do not arrive at the pitch of
perfection necessary to indite a polite letter, so that
consequently there is plenty of employment for the numerous
scribes or Talibs who make a profession of writing. These may
frequently be seen in small rooms opening on to the street,
usually very respectably dressed in a white flowing haik and
large turban, and in most cases of venerable appearance, their
noses being adorned with huge goggles. Before them are their
appliances,--pens made of reeds, ink, paper, and sand in lieu of
blotting paper. They usually possess also a knife and scissors,
with a case to hold them all. In writing, they place the paper on
the knee, or upon a pad of paper in the left hand." The main
merit of the village school in Eastern lands is its noises which
teach the boy to concentrate his attention. As Dr. Wilson of
Bombay said, the young idea is taught to shout as well as to
shoot, and this viva voce process is a far better mnemonic than
silent reading. Moreover it is fine practice in the art of
concentrating attention.

[FN#140] Arab. "Mikshat," whose root would be "Kasht"=skinning (a
camel).

[FN#141] Evidently said ironice as of innocents. In "The Forty
Vezirs" we read, "At length they perceived that all this tumult
arose from their trusting on this wise the words of children."
(Lady's XXth Tale.)

[FN#142] MS. iii. 219-220. For some unaccountable reason it is
omitted by Scott (vi. 76), who 
has written English words in the margin of the W. M. Codex.

[FN#143] In text "Kadum," for "Kudum," a Syrian form.

[FN#144] Arab. "Hidyah," which in Egypt means a falcon; see vol.
iii. 138.

[FN#145] Arab. "Sifah,"=lit. a quality.

[FN#146] Arab. "Istilah"=specific dialect, idiom. See De Sacy,
Chrestomathie, i. 443, where the learned Frenchman shows abundant
learning, but does very little for the learner.

[FN#147] In the text "Kattan"=linen, flax.

[FN#148] Arab. "Fi Jifan ka'l-Jawabi!" which, I suppose, means
small things (or men) and great.

[FN#149] This form of cleverness is a favourite topic in Arabian
folk-lore. The model man was Iyas al-Muzani, al-Kazi (of
Bassorah), in the 2nd century A.H., mentioned by Al-Hariri in his
7th Ass. and noted in Arab. Prov. (i. 593) as "more intelligent
than Iyas." Ibn Khallikan (i. 233) tells sundry curious tales of
him. Hearing a Jew ridicule the Moslem Paradise where the blessed
ate and drank ad libitum but passed nothing away, he asked if all
his food were voided: the Jew replied that God converted a part
of it into nourishment and he rejoined, "Then why not the whole?"
Being once in a courtyard he said that there was an animal under
the bricks and a serpent was found: he had noted that only two of
the tiles showed signs of dampness and this proved that there was
something underneath that breathed. Al-Maydani relates of him
that hearing a dog bark, he declared that the beast was tied to
the brink of a well; and he judged so because the bark was
followed by an echo. Two men came before him, the complainant
claimed money received by the defendant who denied the debt. Iyas
asked the plaintiff where he had given it, and was answered,
"Under a certain tree." The judge told him to go there by way of
refreshing his memory and in his absence asked the defendant if
his adversary could have reached it. "Not yet," said the rogue,
forgetting himself; "'tis a long way off"--which answer convicted
him. Seeing three women act upon a sudden alarm, he said, "One of
them is pregnant, another is nursing, and the third is a virgin."
He explained his diagnosis as follows: "In time of danger persons
lay their hands on what they most prize. Now I saw the pregnant
woman in her flight place her hand on her belly, which showed me
she was with child; the nurse placed her hand on her bosom,
whereby I knew that she was suckling, and the third covered her
parts with her hand proving to me that she was a maid."
(Chenery's Al Hariri, p. 334.)

[FN#150] Such an address would be suited only to a King or a
ruler.

[FN#151] MS. iii. 231-240; Scott's "Story of the Sisters and the
Sultana their mother," vi. 82; Gauttier's Histoire de la Sulthane
et de ses trois Filles, vi. 228.

[FN#152] Arab, "Darajatani"=lit. two astronomical degrees: the
word is often used in this MS.

[FN#153] Arab. "Siwan;" plur. "Siwawin."

[FN#154] Arab. "'Ala hudud (or Ala hadd) al-Shauk," repeated in
MS. iii. 239.

[FN#155] Here the writer, forgetting that the youngest sister is
speaking, breaks out into the third person--"their case"--"their
mother," etc.

[FN#156] The idea is that of the French anonyma's "Mais,
Monsieur, vous me suivez comme un lavement."

[FN#157] The text (p. 243) speaks of two eunuchs, but only one
has been noticed.

[FN#158] Arab. "Manjanik;" there are two forms of this word from
the Gr. {Greek}, or {Greek}, and it survives in our mangonel, a
battering engine. The idea in the text is borrowed from the life
of Abraham whom Nimrod cast by means of a catapult (which is a
bow worked by machinery) into a fire too hot for man to approach.

[FN#159] Showing that he was older; otherwise she would have
addressed him, "O my cousin." A man is "young," in Arab speech,
till forty and some say fifty.

[FN#160] The little precatory formula would keep off the Evil
Eye.

[FN#161] Supper comes first because the day begins at sundown.

[FN#162] Calotte or skull-cap; vol. i. 224; viii. 120.

[FN#163] This is a new "fact" in physics and certainly to be
counted amongst "things not generally known." But Easterns have a
host of "dodges" to detect physiological differences such as
between man and maid, virgin and matron, imperfect castratos and
perfect eunuchs and so forth. Very Eastern, mutatis mutandis, is
the tale of the thief-catcher, who discovered a fellow in
feminine attire by throwing an object for him to catch in his lap
and by his closing his legs instead of opening them wide as the
petticoated ones would do.

[FN#164] She did not wish to part with her maidenhead at so cheap
a price.

[FN#165] Arab. "Subu'" (for "Yaum al-Subu'") a festival prepared
on the seventh day after a birth or a marriage or return from
pilgrimage. See Lane (M. E. passim) under "Subooa."

[FN#166] For this Anglo-Indian term,=a running courier, see vol.
vii. 340. It is the gist of the venerable Joe Miller in which the
father asks a friend to name his seven-months child. "Call him
'Cossid' for verily he hath accomplished a march of nine months
in seven months."

[FN#167] Arab. "Madafi al-Salamah," a custom showing the date of
the tale to be more modern than any in the ten vols. of The
Nights proper.

[FN#168] Master, captain, skipper (not owner): see vols. i. 127;
vi. 112.

[FN#169] Zahr al-Bahr=the surface which affords a passage to man.

[FN#170] Arab. "Batiyah," gen.=a black jack, a leathern flagon.

[FN#171] "Kunafah"=a vermicelli cake often eaten at breakfast:
see vol. x. 1: "Kunafani" is the baker or confectioner. Scott (p.
101) converts the latter into a "maker of cotton wallets for
travelling."

[FN#172] In the text (iii. 260) "Midi," a clerical error for
"Mayyidi," an abbreviation of "Muayyadi," the Faddah, Nuss or
half-dirham coined under Sultan al-Muayyad, A.H. ixth cent.=A.D.
xvth.

[FN#173] Arab. "Rub'" (plur. "Arba'")=the fourth of a "Waybah,"
the latter being the sixth of an Ardabb (Irdabb)=5 bushels. See
vol. i. 263.

[FN#174] A royal pavilion; according to Shakespear (Hind. Dict.
sub voce) it is a corruption of the Pers. "Sayaban."=canopy.

[FN#175] Arab. "Musajja'"=rhymed prose: for the Saj'a, see vol.
i. 116, and Terminal Essay, vol. x. p. 220. So Chaucer:--

     In rhyme or elles in cadence.

[FN#176] Arab. "Huwa inna na'rifu-h" lit.=He, verily we wot him
not: the juxtaposition of the two first pronouns is intended to
suggest "I am he."

[FN#177] In Moslem tales decency compels the maiden, however much
she may be in love, to show extreme unwillingness in parting with
her maidenhead especially by marriage; and this farce is enacted
in real life (see vol. viii. 40). The French tell the indecent
truth,

     Desir de fille est un feu qui devore:
     Desir de femme est plus fort encore.

[FN#178] The Arab. form (our old "bashaw") of the Turk. "Pasha,"
which the French and many English write Pacha, thus confusing the
vulgar who called Ibrahim Pacha "Abraham Parker." The origin of
the word is much debated and the most fanciful derivations have
been proposed. Some have taken it from the Sansk. "Paksha"=a
wing: Fuerst from Pers. Paigah=rank, dignity; Von Hammer
(History) from Pai-Shah=foot of the king; many from
"Padishah"=the Sovran, and Mr. E. T. W. Gibb suspects a
connection with the Turk. "Bash"=a head. He writes to me that the
oldest forms are "Bashah" and "Bashah"; and takes the following
quotation from Colonel Jevad Bey, author of an excellent work on
the Janissaries published a few years ago. "As it was the custom
of the (ancient) Turks to call the eldest son 'Pasha,' the same
style was given to his son Ala al-Din (Aladdin) by Osman Ghazi,
the founder of the Empire; and he kept this heir at home and
beside him, whilst he employed the cadet Orkhan Bey as his
commander-in-chief. When Orkhan Ghazi ascended the throne he
conferred the title of Pasha upon his son Sulayman. Presently
reigned Murad (Amurath), who spying signs of disaffection in his
first-born Sawuji Bey about the middle of his reign created Kara
Khalil (his Kazi-Askar or High Chancellor) Wazir with the title
Kazyr al-Din Pasha; thus making him, as it were, an adopted son.
After this the word passed into the category of official titles
and came to be conferred upon those who received high office."
Colonel Jevad Bey then quotes in support of his opinion the
"History of Munajjim Pasha" and the "Fatayah
al-Waku'at"=Victories of Events. I may note that the old title
has been sadly prostituted in Egypt as well as in Turkey: in 1851
Pashas could be numbered on a man's fingers; now they are
innumerable and of no account.

[FN#179] Arab. "'Ala babi 'llah"=for the love of the Lord,
