indow that gave upon the
garden. The castratos then set before them all manner rich
meats and they ate, Daulat Khatun feeding her foster-sister by
mouthfuls,[FN#453] till she was satisfied; when she called for
divers kinds of sweetmeats, and when the neutrals brought
them, they ate what they would of them and washed their hands.
After this Daulat Khatun made ready wine and its service,
setting on the ewers and bowls and she proceeded to crown the
cups and give Badi'a al-amal to drink, filling for herself
after and drinking in turn. The Badi'a al-Jamal looked from
the window into the garden and gazed upon the fruits and
branches that were therein, till her glance fell on Sayf
al-Muluk, and she saw him wandering about the parterres,
followed by Sa'id, and she heard him recite verses, raining
the while railing tears. And that glance of eyes cost her a
thousand signs,--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased saying her permitted say.

    When it was the Seven Hundred and Seventy-fifth Night,

She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that
when Badi'a al-Jamal caught sight of Sayf al-Muluk as he
wandered about the garden, that glance of eyes cost her a
thousand sighs, and she turned to Daulat Khatun and said to
her (and indeed the wine sported with her senses), "O my
sister, who is that young man I see in the garden, distraught,
love-abying, disappointed, sighing?" Quoth the other, "Dost
thou give me leave to bring him hither, that we may look on
him?"; and quoth the other, "An thou can avail to bring him,
bring him." So Daulat Khatun called to him, saying "O King's
son, come up to us and bring us thy beauty and thy
loveliness!" Sayf al-Muluk recognised her voice and came up to
into the pavilion; but no sooner had he set eyes on Badi'a
al-Jamal, than he fell down in a swoon; whereupon Daulat
Khatun sprinkled on him a little rose-water and he revived.
Then he rose and kissed ground before Badi'a al-Jamal who was
amazed at his beauty and loveliness; and Daulat Khatun said to
her, "Know, O Princess, that this is Sayf al-Muluk, whose hand
saved me by the ordinance of Allah Almighty and he it is who
hath borne all manner burthens on thine account: wherefore I
would have thee look upon him with favour." Hearing this
Badi'a al-Jamal laughed and said, "And who keepeth faith, that
this youth should do so? For there is no true love in men."
Cried Sayf al-Muluk, "O Princess, never shall lack of faith be
in me, and all men are not created alike." And he wept before
her and recited these verses,

"O thou, Badi'a 'l-Jamal, show thou some clemency * To one
     those lovely eyes opprest with witchery!
By rights of beauteous hues and tints thy cheeks combine * Of
     snowy white and glowing red anemone,
Punish not with disdain one who is sorely sick * By long, long
     parting waste hath waxed this frame of me:
This is my wish, my will, the end of my desire, * And Union is
     my hope an haply this may be!"

Then he wept with violent weeping; and love and longing got
the mastery over him and he greeted her with these couplets,

"Peace be to you from lover's wasted love, * All noble hearts
     to noble favour show:
Peace be to you! Ne'er fail your form my dreams; * Nor hall
     nor chamber the fair sight forego!
Of you I'm jealous: none may name your name: * Lovers to
     lovers aye should bend thee low:
So cut not off your grace from him who loves * While sickness
     wastes and sorrows overthrow.
I watch the flowery stars which frighten me; * While cark and
     care mine every night foreslow.
Nor Patience bides with me nor plan appears: * What shall I
     say when questioned of my foe?
God's peace be with you in the hour of need, * Peace sent by
     lover patient bearing woe!"

Then for the excess of his desire and ecstasy he repeated
these coupletes also,

"If I to aught save you, O lords of me, incline; * Ne'er may I
     win of you my wish, my sole design!
Who doth comprise all loveliness save only you? * Who makes
     the Doomsday dawn e'en now before these eyne?
Far be it Love find any rest, for I am one * Who lost for love
     of you this heart, these vitals mine."

When he had made an end of his verses, he wept with sore
weeping and she said to him, "O Prince, I fear to grant myself
wholly to thee lest I find in thee nor fondness nor affection;
for oftentimes man's fidelity is small and his perfidy is
great and thou knowest how the lord Solomon, son of David (on
whom be the Peace!), took Bilkis to his love but, whenas he
saw another fairer than she, turned from her thereto." Sayf
al-Muluk replied, "O my eye and O my soul, Allah hath not made
all men alike, and I, Inshallah, will keep my troth and die
beneath thy feet. Soon shalt thou see what I will do in
accordance with my words, and for whatso I say Allah is my
warrant." Quoth Badi'a al-Jamal, "Sit and be of good heart and
swear to me by the right of thy Faith and let us covenant
together that each will not be false to other; and whichever
of us breaketh faith may Almighty Allah punish!" At these
words he sat down and set his hand in her hand and they sware
each to other that neither of them would ever prefer to the
other any one, either of man or of the Jann. Then they
embraced for a whole hour and wept for excess of their joy,
whilst passion overcame Sayf al-Muluk and he recited these
couplets,

"I weep for longing love's own ardency * To her who claims the
     heart and soul of me.
And sore's my sorrow parted long from you, * And short's my
     arm to reach the prize I see;
And mourning grief for what my patience marred * To blamer's
     eye unveiled my secresy;
And waxed strait that whilome was so wide * Patience nor force
     remains nor power to dree.
Would Heaven I knew if God will ever deign to join * Our
     lives, and from our cark and care and grief set free!"

After this mutual troth-plighting, Sayf al-Muluk arose and
walked in the garden and Badi'a al-Jamal arose also and went
forth also afoot followed by a slave-girl bearing somewhat of
food and a flask[FN#454] of wine. The Princess sat down and
the damsel set the meat and wine before her: nor remained they
long ere they were joined by Sayf al-Muluk, who was received
with greeting and the two embraced and sat them down.--And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say.

    When it was the Seven Hundred and Seventy-sixth Night,

She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that
having provided food and wine, Badi'a al-Jamal met Sayf
al-Muluk with greetings, and the twain having embraced and
kissed sat them down awhile to eat and drink. Then said she to
him, "O King's son, thou must now go to the garden of Iram,
where dwelleth my grandmother, and seek her consent to our
marriage. My slave-girl Marjanah will convey thee thither and
as thou farest therein thou wilt see a great pavilion of red
satin, lined with green silk. Enter the pavilion heartening
thyself and thou wilt see inside it an ancient dame sitting on
a couch of red gold set with pearls and jewels. Salute her
with respect and courtesy: then look at the foot of the couch,
where thou wilt descry a pair of sandals[FN#455] of cloth
interwoven with bars of gold, embroidered with jewels. Take
them and kiss them and lay them on thy head[FN#456]; then put
them under thy right armpit and stand before the old woman, in
silence and with thy head bowed down. If she ask thee, 'Who
art thou and how camest thou hither and who led thee to this
land? And why hast thou taken up the sandals?' make her no
answer, but abide silent till Marjanah enter, when she will
speak with her and seek to win her aproof for thee and cause
her look on thee with consent; so haply Allah Almight may
incline her heart to thee and she may grant thee thy wish."
Then she called the handmaid Marjanah hight and said to her,
"As thou lovest me, do my errand this day and be not
neglectful therein! An thou acccomplish it, thou shalt be a
free woman for the sake of Allah Almighty, and I will deal
honourably by thee with gifts and there shall be none dearer
to me than thou, nor will I discover my secrets to any save
thee. So, by my love for thee, fulfil this my need and be not
slothful therein." Replied Marjanah, "O my lady and light of
mine eyes, tell me what is it thou requirest of me, that I may
accomplish it with both mine eyes." Badi'a rejoined, "Take
this mortal on thy shoulders and bear him to the bloom-garden
of Iram and the pavilion of my grandmother, my father's
mother, and be careful of his safety. When thou hast brought
him into her presence and seest him take the slippers and do
them homage, and hearest her ask him, saying, 'Whence art thou
and by what road art come and who led thee to this land, and
why hast thou taken up the sandals and what is thy need that I
give heed to it?' do thou come forward in haste and salute her
with the salam and say to her, 'O my lady, I am she who
brought him hither and he is the King's son of Egypt.[FN#457]
'Tis he who went to the High-builded Castle and slew the son
of the Blue King and delivered the Princess Daulat Khatun from
the Castle of Japhet son of Noah and brought her back safe to
her father: and I have brought him to thee, that he may give
thee the glad tidings of her safety: so deign thou be gracious
to him.' Then do thou say to her, 'Allah upon thee! is not
this young man handsome, O my lady?' She will reply, 'Yes';
and do thou rejoin, 'O my lady, indeed he is complete in
honour and manhood and valour and he is lord and King of Egypt
and compriseth all praiseworthy qualities.' An she ask thee,
'What is his need?' do thou make answer, 'My lady saluteth
thee and saith to thee, how long shall she sit at home, a maid
and unmarried? Indeed, the time is longsome upon her for she
is as a magazine wherein wheat is heaped up.[FN#458] What then
is thine intent in leaving her without a mate and why dost
thou not marry her in thy lifetide and that of her mother,
like other girls?' If she say, 'How shall we do to marry her?
An she have any one in mind, let her tell us of him, and we
will do her will as far as may be!" do thou make answer, 'O my
lady, thy daughter saith to thee, 'Ye were minded aforetime to
marry me to Solomon (on whom be peace!) and portrayed him my
portrait on a tunic. But he had no lot in me; so he sent the
tunic to the King of Egypt and he gave it to his son, who saw
my portrait figured thereon and fell in love with me;
wherefore he left his father and mother's realm and turning
away from the world and whatso is therein, went forth at a
venture, a wanderer, love-distraught, and hath borne the
utmost hardships and honours for my sake of me.' Now thou
seest his beauty and loveliness, and thy daughter's heart is
enamoured of him; so if ye have a mind to marry her, marry her
to this young man and forbid her not from him for he is young
and passing comely and King of Egypt, nor wilt thou find a
goodlier than he; and if ye will not give her to him, she will
slay herself and marry none neither man nor Jinn.'" "And,"
continued Badi'a al-Jamal, "Look thou, O Marjanah, ma
mie,[FN#459] how thou mayst do with my grandmother, to win her
consent, and beguile her with soft words, so haply she may do
my desire." Quoth the damsel, "O my lady, upon my head and
eyes will I serve thee and do what shall content thee." Then
she took Sayf al-Muluk on her shoulders and said to him, "O
King's son, shut thine eyes." He did so and she flew up with
him into the welkin; and after awhile she said to him, "O
King's son, open thine eyes." He opened them and found himself
in a garden, which was none other than the garden of Iram; and
she showed him the pavilion and said, "O Sayf al-Muluk, enter
therein!" Thereupon he pronounced the name of Allah Almighty
and entering cast a look upon the garden, when he saw the old
Queen sitting on the couch, attended by her waiting women. So
he drew near her with courtesy and reverence and taking the
sandals bussed them and did as Badi'a al-Jamal had enjoined
him. Quoth the ancient dame, "Who art thou and what is thy
country; whence comest thou and who brought thee hither and
what may be thy wish? Wherefore dost thou take the sandals and
kiss them and when didst thou ask of me a favour which I did
not grant?" With this in came Marjanah[FN#460] and saluting
her reverently and worshipfully, repeated to her what Badi'a
al-Jamal had told her; which when the old Queen heard, she
cried out at her and was wroth with her and said, "How shall
there be accord between man and Jinn?"--And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.






End of Vol. 7






                   Arabian Nights, Volume 7
                          Footnotes


[FN#1] Mayyafarikin, whose adjective for shortness is
"Fariki": the place is often mentioned in The Nights as the
then capital of Diyar Bakr, thirty parasangs from Nasibin, the
classical Nisibis, between the upper Euphrates and Tigris.

[FN#2] This proportion is singular to moderns but
characterised Arab and more especially Turcoman armies.

[FN#3] Such is the bathos caused by the Saja'-assonance: in
the music of the Arabic it contrasts strangely with the
baldness of translation. The same is the case with the Koran
beautiful in the original and miserably dull in European
languages, it is like the glorious style of the "Anglican
Version" by the side of its bastard brothers in Hindostani or
Marathi; one of these marvels of stupidity translating the
"Lamb of God" by "God's little goat.

[FN#4] This incident is taken from the Life of Mohammed who,
in the "Year of Missions" (A. H. 7) sent letters to foreign
potentates bidding them embrace Al-Islam, and, his seal being
in three lines, Mohammed|Apostle|of Allah, Khusrau Parwiz
(=the Charming) was offended because his name was placed below
Mohammed's. So he tore the letter in pieces adding, says
Firdausi, these words:--

          Hath the Arab's daring performed such feat,
          Fed on camel's milk and the lizard's meat, 
          That he cast on Kayanian crown his eye?
          Fie, O whirling world! on thy faith and fie!

Hearing of this insult Mohammed exclaimed, "Allah shall tear
his kingdom!" a prophecy which was of course fulfilled, or we
should not have heard of it. These lines are horribly
mutilated in the Dabistan (iii. 99).

[FN#5] This "Taklid" must not be translated "girt on the
sword." The Arab carries his weapon by a baldrick or bandoleer
passed over his right shoulder. In modern days the " Majdal"
over the left shoulder supports on the right hip a line of
Tatarif or brass cylinders for cartridges: the other cross-
belt (Al-Masdar) bears on the left side the Kharizah or
bullet-pouch of hide; and the Hizam or waist-belt holds the
dagger and extra cartridges. (Pilgrimage iii. 90.) 

[FN#6] Arab. "Bab," which may mean door or gate. The plural
form (Abwab) occurs in the next line, meaning that he
displayed all manner of martial prowess.

[FN#7] Arab. "Farrash" (also used in Persian), a man of
general utility who pitches tents, speeps the floors.
administers floggings, etc. etc. (Pilgrimage iii. 90.) 

[FN#8] i.e. the slogan-cry of "Allaho Akbar," which M. C.
Barbier de Meynard compares with the Christian "Te Deum."

[FN#9] The Anglo-Indian term for the Moslem rite of killing
animals for food. (Pilgrimage i. 377.) 

[FN#10] Arab. "tawilan jiddan" a hideous Cairenism in these
days; but formerly used by Al-Mas'udi and other good writers.

[FN#11] Arab. " 'Ajwah," enucleated dates pressed together
into a solid mass so as to be sliced with a knife like cold
pudding. The allusion is to the dough-idols of the Hanifah
tribe, whose eating their gods made the saturnine Caliph Omar
laugh.

[FN#12] Mr. Payne writes "Julned." In a fancy name we must not
look for grammar, but a quiescent lam (l) followed by nun (n)
is unknown to Arabic while we find sundry cases of "lan"
(fath'd lam and nun), and Jalandah means noxious or injurious.
In Oman also there was a dynasty called Julandah. for which
see Mr. Badger (xiii. and passim).

[FN#13] Doubtless for Jawan-mard--un giovane, a brave See vol.
iv., p. 208.

[FN#14] Mr. Payne transposes the distichs, making the last
first. I have followed the Arabic order finding it in the Mac.
and Bul. Edits. (ii. 129).

[FN#15] Al-Irak like Al-Yaman may lose the article in verse.

[FN#16] Arab. "Ka'ka'at": hence Jabal Ka'ka'an, the higher
levels in Meccah, of old inhabited by the Jurhamites and so
called from their clashing and jangling arms; whilst the
Amalekites dwelt in the lower grounds called Jiyad from their
generous steeds. (Pilgrimage iii. 191.)

[FN#17] Al-Shara', a mountain in Arabia.

[FN#18] See vol. vi., 249. "This (mace) is a dangerous weapon
when struck on the shoulders or unguarded arm: I am convinced
that a blow with it on a head armoured with a salade (cassis
caelata, a light iron helmet) would stun a man" (says La
Brocquiere). 

[FN#19] Oman, which the natives pronounce "Aman," is the
region best known by its capital Maskat. These are the Omana
Moscha and Omanum Emporium of Ptolemy and the Periplus. Ibn
Batutah writes Amman, but the best dictionaries give "Oman."
(N.B.--Mr. Badger, p. 1, wrongly derives Sachalitis from
"Sawahily": it is evidently "Sahili.") The people bear by no
means the best character: Ibn Batutah (fourteenth century)
says, "their wives are most base; yet, without denying this,
their husbands express nothing like jealousy on the subject."
(Lee, p. 62.)

[FN#20] The name I have said of a quasi-historical personage,
son of Joktan, the first Arabist and the founder of the Tobba
("successor") dynasty in Al-Yaman; while Jurham, his brother,
established that of Al-Hijaz. The name is probably chosen
because well-known.

[FN#21] Arab. "Hakim": lit. one who orders; often confounded
by the unscientific with Hakim, doctor, a philosopher. The
latter re-appears in the Heb. Khakham applied in modern days
to the Jewish scribe who takes the place of the Rabbi.

[FN#22] As has been seen, acids have ever been and are still
administered as counter-inebriants, while hot spices and
sweets greatly increase the effect of Bhang, opium, henbane,
datura &c. The Persians have a most unpleasant form of
treating men when dead-drunk with wine or spirits. They hang
them up by the heels, as we used to do with the drowned, and
stuff their mouths with human ordure which is sure to produce
emesis.

[FN#23] Compare the description of the elephant-faced Vetala
(Katha S.S. Fasc. xi. p. 388).

[FN#24] The lover's name Sa'ik= the Striker (with lightning);
Najmah, the beloved= the star.

[FN#25] I have modified the last three lines of the Mac. Edit.
which contain a repetition evidently introduced by the
carelessness of the copyist.

[FN#26] The Hindu Charvakas explain the Triad, Bramha, Vishnu
and Shiva, by the sexual organs and upon Vishnu's having four
arms they gloss, "At the time of sexual intercourse, each man
and woman has as many." (Dabistan ii. 202.) This is the
Eastern view of Rabelais' "beast with two backs." 

[FN#27] Arab. "Rabbat-i," my she Lord, fire (nar) being
feminine.

[FN#28] The prose-rhyme is answerable for this galimatias.

[FN#29] A common phrase equivalent to our "started from his
head."

[FN#30] Arab. "Mariduna"=rebels (against Allah and his
orders).

[FN#31] Arab. Yafis or Yafat. He had eleven sons and was
entitled Abu al-Turk because this one engendered the Turcomans
as others did the Chinese, Scythians, Slaves (Saklab), Gog,
Magog, and the Muscovites or Russians. According to the
Moslems there was a rapid falling off in size amongst this
family. Noah's grave at Karak (the Ruin) a suburb of Zahlah,
in La Brocquiere's "Valley of Noah, where the Ark was built,"
is 104 ft. 10 in. Iong by 8 ft. 8 in. broad. (N.B.--It is a
bit of the old aqueduct which Mr. Porter, the learned author
of the "Giant Cities of Bashan," quotes as a "traditional
memorial of primeval giants"--talibus carduis pascuntur
asini!). Nabi Ham measures only 9 ft. 6 in. between headstone
and tombstone, being in fact about as long as his father was
broad.

[FN#32] See Night dcliv., vol. vii, p. 43, infra.

[FN#33] According to Turcoman legends (evidently pose-
Mohammedan) Noah gave his son, Japhet a stone inscribed with
the Greatest Name, and it had the virtue of bringing on or
driving off rain. The Moghuls long preserved the tradition and
hence probably the sword.

[FN#34] This expresses Moslem sentiment; the convert to Al-
Islam being theoretically respected and practically despised.
The Turks call him a "Burma"=twister, a turncoat, and no one
either trusts him or believes in his sincerity.

[FN#35] The name of the city first appears here: it is found
also in the Bul. Edit., vol. ii. p. 132.

[FN#36] Arab. " 'Amala hilah," a Syro-Egyptian vulgarism.

[FN#37] i.e. his cousin, but he will not use the word.

[FN#38] Arab. "La'ab," meaning very serious use of the sword:
we still preserve the old "sword-play." 

[FN#39] Arab. " Ikhsa,"  from a root meaning to drive away a
dog.

[FN#40] Arab. "Hazza-hu," the quivering motion given to the
"Harbak" (a light throw-spear or javelin) before it leaves the
hand. 

[FN#41] Here the translator must either order the sequence of
the sentences or follow the rhyme.

[FN#42] Possibly taken from the Lions' Court in the
Alhambra=(Dar) Al-hamra, the Red House.

[FN#43] Arab. "Shazarwan" from Pers. Shadurwan, a palace,
cornice, etc. That of the Meccan Ka'abah is a projection of
about a foot broad in pent-house shape sloping downwards and
two feet above the granite pavement: its only use appears in
the large brass rings welded into it to hold down the
covering. There are two breaks in it, one under the doorway
and the other opposite Ishmael's tomb; and pilgrims are
directed during circuit to keep the whole body outside it.

[FN#44] The "Musafahah" before noticed, vol. vi., p. 287.

[FN#45] i.e. He was confounded at its beauty.

[FN#46] Arab. "'Ajib," punning upon the name. 

[FN#47] Arab. "Zarraf" (whence our word) from "Zarf"=walking
hastily: the old "cameleopard" which originated the nursery
idea of its origin. It is one of the most timid of the
antelope tribe and unfit for riding.

[FN#48] Arab. "Takht," a useful word, meaning even a saddle.
The usual term is "Haudaj"=the Anglo Indian "howdah."

[FN#49] "Thunder-King," Arab. and Persian.

[FN#50] i.e. "He who violently assaults his peers" (the best
men of the age). Batshat al- Kubra=the Great Disaster, is
applied to the unhappy "Battle of Bedr" (Badr) on Ramazan 17,
A.H. 2 (=Jan. 13, 624) when Mohammed was so nearly defeated
that the Angels were obliged to assist him (Koran, chapts.
iii. 11; i. 42; viii. 9). Mohammed is soundly rated by
Christian writers for beheading two prisoners Utbah ibn Rabi'a
who had once spat on his face and Nazir ibn Haris who recited
Persian romances and preferred them to the "foolish fables of
the Koran." What would our forefathers have done to a man who
spat in the face of John Knox and openly preferred a French
play to Pentateuch ? 

[FN#51] Arab. "Jilbab" either habergeon (mail-coat) or the
buff-jacket worn under it.
   
[FN#52] A favourite way, rough and ready, of carrying light
weapons, often alluded to in The Nights. So Khusrawan in Antar
carried "under his thighs four small darts, each like a
blazing flame."

[FN#53] Mr. Payne very reasonably supplants here and below
Fakhr Taj (who in Night dcxxxiv is left in her father's palace
and who is reported to be dead in Night dclxvii.) by Star o'
Morn. But the former is also given in the Bul. Edit. (ii.
148), so the story teller must have forgotten all about her. I
leave it as a model specimen of Eastern incuriousness.

[FN#54] There is some chivalry in his unwillingness to use the
magical blade. As a rule the Knights of Romance utterly ignore
fair play and take every dirty advantage in the magic line
that comes to hand. 

[FN#55] Arab. "Hammal al-Hatabi"=one who carries to market the
fuel-sticks which he picks up m the waste. In the Koran
(chaps. cxi.) it is applied to Umm Jamil, wife of Mohammed's
hostile cousin, Abd al-Uzza, there termed Abu Lahab (Father of
smokeless Flame) with the implied meaning that she will bear
fuel to feed Hell-fire.

[FN#56] Arab. "Akyal," lit. whose word (Kaul) is obeyed, a
title of the Himyarite Kings, of whom Al-Bergendi relates that
one of them left an inscription at Samarcand, which many
centuries ago no man could read. This evidently alludes to the
dynasty which preceded the "Tobba" and to No. xxiv. Shamar
Yar'ash (Shamar the Palsied). Some make him son of Malik
surnamed Nashir al-Ni'am (Scatterer of Blessings) others of
Afrikus (No. xviii.), who, according to Al-Jannabi, Ahmad bin
Yusuf and Ibn Ibdun (Pocock, Spec. Hist. Arab.) founded the
Berber (Barber) race, the remnants of the Causanites expelled
by the "robber, Joshua son of Nun," and became the eponymus of
"Africa." This word which, under the Romans, denoted a small
province on the Northern Sea-board, is, I would suggest,
A'far-Kahi (Afar-land), the Afar being now the Dankali race,
the country of Osiris whom my learned friend, the late
Mariette Pasha, derived from the Egyptian "Punt" identified by
him with the Somali country. This would make "Africa," as it
ought to be, an Egyptian (Coptic) term.

[FN#57] Herodotus (i. 80) notes this concerning the camel.
Elephants are not allowed to walk the streets in Anglo-Indian
cities, where they have caused many accidents.

[FN#58] Arab. Wahk or Wahak, suggesting the Roman retiarius.
But the lasso pure and simple, the favourite weapon of
shepherd and herdsmen was well-known to the old Egyptians and
in ancient India. It forms one of the T-letters in the
hieroglyphs. 

[FN#59] Compare with this and other Arab battle-pieces the
Pandit's description in the Katha Sarit Sagara, e.g. "Then a
confused battle arose with dint of arrow, javelin, lance, mace
and axe, costing the lives of countless soldiers (N.B.--
Millions are nothing to him); rivers of blood flowed with the
bodies of elephants and horses for alligators, with the pearls
from the heads of elephants for sands and with the heads of
heroes for stones. That feast of battle delighted the flesh-
loving demons who, drunk with blood instead of wine, were
dancing with the palpitating trunks," etc.. etc. Fasc. xii.
526. 

[FN#60] The giraffe is here mal-place: it is, I repeat, one of
the most timid of the antelope tribe. Nothing can be more
graceful than this huge game as it stands under a tree
extending its long and slender neck to the foliage above it;
but when in flight all the limbs seem loose and the head is
carried almost on a level with the back. 

[FN#61] The fire-arms may have been inserted by the copier;
the cross-bow (Arcubalista) is of unknown antiquity. I have
remarked in my book of the Sword (p. 19) that the bow is the
first crucial evidence of the distinction between the human
weapon and the bestial arm, and like the hymen or membrane of
virginity proves a difference of degree if not of kind between
man and the so-called lower animals. I note from Yule's Marco
Polo (ii., 143) " that the cross-bow was re-introduced into
European warfare during the twelfth century"; but the
arbalesta was well known to the bon roi Charlemagne (Regnier
Sat. X).

[FN#62] In Al-Islam this was unjustifiable homicide, excused
only because the Kafir had tried to slay his own son. He
should have been summoned to become a tributary and then, on
express refusal, he might legally have been put to death.

[FN#63] i.e. "Rose King," like the Sikh name "Gulab
Singh"=Rosewater Lion, sounding in translation almost too
absurd to be true.

[FN#64] "Repentance acquits the penitent" is a favourite and
noble saying popular in Al-Islam. It is first found in Seneca;
and is probably as old as the dawn of literature.

[FN#65] Here an ejaculation of impatience.

[FN#66] i.e. "King Intelligence": it has a ludicrous sound
suggesting only "Dandanha-i-Khirad,,=wisdom-teeth. The Mac.
Edit. persistently keeps "Ward Shah," copyist error. 

[FN#67] i.e. Fakhr Taj, who had been promised him in marriage.
See Night dcxxxlii. supra, vol. vi.

[FN#68] The name does not appear till further on, after vague
Eastern fashion which, here and elsewhere I have not had the
heart to adopt. The same may be found in Ariosto, passim.

[FN#69] A town in Persian Irak, unhappily far from the "Salt
sea."

[FN#70] "Earthquake son of Ennosigaius" (the Earthquake-
maker).

[FN#71] Arab. "Ruba'al-Kharab" or Ruba'al-Khali (empty
quarter), the great central wilderness of Arabia covering some
50,000 square miles and still left white on our maps.
(Pilgrimage, i 14.)

[FN#72] Pers. "Life King", women also assume the title of
Shah.

[FN#73] Arab. "Mujauhar": the watery or wavy mark upon Eastern
blades is called the "jauhar," lit.=jewel. The peculiarity is
also called water and grain, which gives rise to a host of
double-entendres, puns, paronomasias and conceits more or less
frigid.

[FN#74] Etymologically meaning tyrants or giants; and applied
to great heathen conquerors like Nimrod and the mighty rulers
of Syria, the Anakim, Giants and other peoples of Hebrew
fable. The Akasirah are the Chosroes before noticed.

[FN#75] Arab. "Asker jarrar" lit. "drawing": so in Egyptian
slang "Nas jarrar"=folk who wish to draw your money out of
your pocket, greedy cheats.

[FN#76] In Turkestan: the name means "Two lights."

[FN#77] In Armenia, mentioned by Sadik Isfahani (Transl. p.
62).

[FN#78] This is the only ludicrous incident in the tale which
justifies Von Hammer's suspicion. Compare it with the combat
between Rustam and his son Sohrab.

[FN#79] I cannot understand why Trebutien, iii., 457, writes
this word Afba. He remarks that it is the "Oina and Riya" of
Jami, elegantly translated by M. de Chezy in the Journal
Asiatique, vol. 1, 144.

[FN#80] I have described this part of the Medinah Mosque in
Pilgrimage ii., 62-69. The name derives from a saying of
Mohammed (of which there are many variants), "Between my tomb
and my pulpit is a garden of the Gardens of Paradise"
(Burckhardt, Arabia, p. 337). The whole Southern portico (not
only a part) now enjoys that honoured name and the tawdry
decorations are intended to suggest a parterre.

[FN#81] Mohammed's companions (Ashab), numbering some five
hundred, were divided into two orders, the Muhajirin
(fugitives) or Meccans who accompanied the Apostle to
Al-Medinah (Pilgrimage ii. 138) and the Ansar (Auxiliaries) or
Medinites who invited him to their city and lent him zealous
aid (Ibid. ii. 130). The terms constantly occur in Arab
history.

[FN#82] The "Mosque of the Troops," also called Al-Fath
(victory), the largest of the "Four Mosques:" it is still a
place of pious visitation where prayer is granted. Koran,
chap. xxxiii., and Pilgrimage ii. 325.

[FN#83] Arab. "Al-Wars," with two meanings. The Alfaz Adwiyah
gives it=Kurkum, curcuma, turmeric, safran d'Inde; but popular
usage assigns it to Usfur, Kurtum or safflower (carthamus
tinctorius). I saw the shrub growing all about Harar which
exports it, and it is plentiful in Al-Yaman (Niebuhr, p. 133),
where women affect it to stain the skin a light yellow and
remove freckles: it is also an internal remedy in leprosy. But
the main use is that of a dye, and the Tob stained with Wars
is almost universal in some parts of Arabia. Sonnini (p. 510)
describes it at length and says that Europeans in Egypt call
it "Parrot-seeds" because the bird loves it, and the Levant
trader "Saffrenum."

[FN#84] Two men of the great 'Anazah race went forth to gather
Karaz, the fruit of the Sant (Mimosa Nilotica) both used for
tanning, and never returned. Hence the proverb which is
obsolete in conversation. See Burckhardt, Prov. 659: where it
takes the place of "ad Graecas Kalendas."

[FN#85] Name of a desert (Mafazah) and a settlement on the
Euphrates' bank between Basrah and the site of old Kufah near
Kerbela; the well known visitation place in Babylonian Irak.

[FN#86] Of the Banu Sulaym tribe; the adjective is Sulami not
Sulaymi.

[FN#87] Arab. "Amam-ak"=before thee (in space); from the same
root as Imam=antistes, leader of prayer; and conducing to
perpetual puns, e.g. "You are Imam-i (my leader) and therefore
should be Amam-i" (in advance of me).

[FN#88] He was angry, as presently appears, because he had
heard of certain love passages between the two and this in
Arabia is a dishonour to the family.

[FN#89] Euphemy for "my daughter."

[FN#90] The Badawin call a sound dollar "Kirsh hajar" or
"Riyal hajar" (a stone dollar; but the word is spelt with the
greater h).

[FN#91] Arab. Burdah and Habarah. The former often translated
mantle is a thick woollen stuff, brown or gray, woven oblong
and used like a plaid by day and by night. Mohammed's Burdah
woven in his Harem and given to the poet, Ka'ab, was 7 1/2 ft.
long by 4 1/2: it is still in the upper Serraglio of Stambul.
In early days the stuff was mostly striped; now it is either
plain or with lines so narrow that it looks like one colour.
The Habarah is a Burd made in Al-Yaman and not to be
confounded with the Egyptian mantilla of like name (Lane, M.
E. chapt. iii.).

[FN#92] Every Eastern city has its special title. Al-Medinah
is entitled "Al-Munawwarah" (the Illumined) from the blinding
light which surrounds the Prophet's tomb and which does not
show to eyes profane (Pilgrimage ii. 3). I presume that the
idea arose from the huge lamps of "The Garden." I have noted
that Mohammed's coffin suspended by magnets is an idea unknown
to Moslems, but we find the fancy in Al-Harawi related of St.
Peter, "Simon Cephas (the rock) is in the City of Great Rome,
in its largest church within a silver ark hanging by chains
from the ceiling." (Lee, Ibn Batutah, p. 161).

[FN#93] Here the fillets are hung instead of the normal
rag-strips to denote an honoured tomb. Lane (iii. 242) and
many others are puzzled about the use of these articles. In
many cases they are suspended to trees in order to transfer
sickness from the body to the tree and whoever shall touch it.
The Sawahili people term such articles a Keti (seat or
vehicle) for the mysterious haunter of the tree who prefers
occupying it to the patient's person. Briefly the custom still
popular throughout Arabia, is African and Fetish.

[FN#94] Al-Mas'udi (chap. xcv.), mentions a Hind bint Asma and
tells a facetious story of her and the "enemy of Allah," the
poet Jarir.

[FN#95] Here the old Shiah hatred of the energetic conqueror
of Oman crops out again. Hind's song is that of Maysum
concerning her husband Mu'awiyah which Mrs. Godfrey Clark
('Ilam-en-Nas, p. 108) thus translates:-- 

     A hut that the winds make tremble
        Is dearer to me than a noble palace;
     And a dish of crumbs on the floor of my home
        Is dearer to me than a varied feast;
     And the soughing of the breeze through every crevice
        Is dearer to me than the beating of drums.

Compare with Dr. Carlyle's No. X.:-- 

     The russet suit of camel's hair
        With spirits light and eye serene
     Is dearer to my bosom far
        Than all the trappings of a queen, etc. etc.

And with mine (Pilgrimage iii. 262):-- 

     O take these purple robes away,
        Give back my cloak of camel's hair
     And bear me from this towering pile
        To where the black tents flap i' the air, etc. etc.

[FN#96] AI-Hajjaj's tribal name was Al-Thakifi or descendant
of Thakif. According to Al-Mas'udi, he was son of Farighah
(the tall Beauty) by Yusuf bin Ukayl the Thakafite and vint au
monde tout difforme avec l'anus obstrue. As he refused the
breast, Satan, in human form, advised suckling him with the
blood of two black kids, a black buck-goat and a black snake;
which had the desired effect.

[FN#97] Trebutien, iii., 465, translates these sayings into
Italian.

[FN#98] Making him a "Kawwad"=leader, i.e. pimp; a true piece
of feminine spite. But the Caliph prized Al-Hajjaj too highly
to treat him as in the text.

[FN#99] i.e. "The overflowing," with benefits; on account of
his generosity.

[FN#100] The seventh Ommiade A. H. 96-99 (715-719). He died of
his fine appetite after eating at a sitting a lamb, six fowls,
seventy pomegranates, and 11 1/4 lbs. of currants. He was also
proud of his youth and beauty and was wont to say, "Mohammed
was the Apostle and Abu Bakr witness to the Truth; Omar the
Discriminator and Othman the Bashful, Mu'awiyah the Mild and
Yazid the Patient; Abd al-Malik the Administrator and Walid
the Tyrant; but I am the Young King!"

[FN#101] Arab. Al-Jazirah, "the Island;" name of the region
and the capital.

[FN#102] i.e. "Repairer of the Slips of the Generous," an
evasive reply, which of course did not deceive the questioner.

[FN#103] Arab. "Falastin," now obsolete. The word has echoed
far west and the name of the noble race has been degraded to
"Philister," a bourgeois, a greasy burgher.

[FN#104] Saying, "The Peace be with thee, O Prince of True
Believers!"

[FN#105] Arab. "Mutanakkir," which may also mean proud or in
disguise.

[FN#106] On appointment as viceroy. See vol. iii 307.

[FN#107] The custom with outgoing Governors. It was adopted by
the Spaniards and Portuguese especially in America. The
generosity of Ikrimah without the slightest regard to justice
or common honesty is characteristic of the Arab in
story-books.

[FN#108] The celebrated half-way house between Jaffa and
Jerusalem.

[FN#109] Alias the Kohistan or mountain region, Susiana
(Khuzistan) whose capital was Susa; and the head-quarters of
fire-worship. Azar (fire) was the name of Abraham's father
whom Eusebius calls "Athar." (Pilgrimage iii. 336.) 

[FN#110] Tenth Ommiade A.H. 105-125 (=724-743), a wise and
discreet ruler with an inclination to avarice and asceticism.
According to some, the Ommiades produced only three statesmen,
Mu'awayah, Abd al-Malik and Hisham; and the reign of the
latter was the end of sage government and wise administration.

[FN#111] About œ1,250, which seems a long price; but in those
days Damascus had been enriched with the spoils of the world
adjacent.

[FN#112] Eleventh Ommiade dynasty, A.H. 125-126 (=743-744).
Ibn Sahl (son of ease, i.e. free and easy) was a nickname; he
was the son of Yazid II. and brother of Hisham. He scandalised
the lieges by his profligacy, wishing to make the pilgrimage
in order to drink upon the Ka'abah-roof; so they attacked the
palace and lynched him. His death is supposed to have been
brought about (27th of Jamada al-Akhirah = April 16, 744) by
his cousin and successor Yazid (No. iii.) surnamed the
Retrencher. The tale in the text speaks well for him; but
generosity amongst the Arabs covers a multitude of sins, and
people say, "Better a liberal sinner than a stingy saint."

[FN#113] The tents of black wool woven by the Badawi women are
generally supported by three parallel rows of poles lengthways
and crossways (the highest line being the central) and the
covering is pegged down. Thus the outline of the roofs forms
two or more hanging curves, and these characterise the
architecture of the Tartars and Chinese; they are still
preserved in the Turkish (and sometimes in the European)
"Kiosque," and they have extended to the Brazil where the
upturned eaves, often painted vermilion below, at once attract
the traveller's notice.

[FN#114] See vol. iv., 159. The author of "Antar," known to
Englishmen by the old translation of Mr. Terrick Hamilton,
secretary of Legation at Constantinople. There is an
abridgement of the forty-five volumes of Al-Asma'i's "Antar"
which mostly supplies or rather supplied the "Antariyyah" or
professional tale-tellers; whose theme was the heroic Mulatto
lover.

[FN#115] The "Dakkah" or long wooden sofa, as opposed to the
"mastabah" or stone bench, is often a tall platform and in
mosques is a kind of ambo railed round and supported by
columns. Here readers recite the Koran: Lane (M.E. chapt.
iii.) sketches it in the "Interior of a Mosque."

[FN#116] Alif, Ha and Waw, the first, twenty-seventh and
twenty-sixth letters of the Arabic alphabet: No. 1 is the most
simple and difficult to write caligraphically.

[FN#117] Reeds washed with gold and used for love-letters, &c.

[FN#118] Lane introduced this tale into vol. i., p. 223, notes
on chapt. iii., apparently not knowing that it was in The
Nights. He gives a mere abstract, omitting all the verse, and
he borrowed it either from the Halbat al-Kumayt (chapt. xiv.)
or from Al-Mas'udi (chapt. cxi.). See the French translation,
vol. vi. p. 340. I am at pains to understand why M. C. Barbier
de Maynard writes "Rechid" with an accented vowel; although
French delicacy made him render, by "fils de courtisane," the
expression in the text, "O biter of thy mother's enlarged (or
uncircumcised) clitoris" (Bazar).

[FN#119] In Al-Mas'udi the Devil is "a young man fair of
favour and formous of figure," which is more appropriate to a
"Tempter." He also wears light stuffs of dyed silks.

[FN#120] It would have been more courteous in an utter
stranger to say, O my lord.

[FN#121] The Arab Tempe (of fiction, not of grisly fact).

[FN#122] These four lines are in Al-Mas'udi, chapt, cxviii.
Fr. Trans. vii. 313, but that author does not tell us who
wrote them.

[FN#123] i.e. Father of Bitterness=the Devil. This legend of
the Foul Fiend appearing to Ibrahim of Mosul (and also to
Isam, N. dcxcv.) seems to have been accepted by contemporaries
and reminds us of similar visitations in Europe--notably to
Dr. Faust. One can only exclaim, "Lor, papa, what nonsense you
are talking!" the words of a small girl whose father thought
proper to indoctrinate her into certain Biblical stories. I
once began to write a biography of the Devil; but I found that
European folk-lore had made such an unmitigated fool of the
grand old Typhon-Ahriman as to take away from him all human
interest.

[FN#124] In Al-Mas'udi the Caliph exclaims, "Verily thou hast
received a visit from Satan!"

[FN#125] Al-Mas'udi, chapt. cxix. (Fr. transl. vii., 351)
mentions the Banu Odhrah as famed for lovers and tells the
pathetic tale of 'Orwah and 'Afra.

[FN#126] Jamil bin Ma'amar the poet has been noticed in Vol.
ii. 102; and he has no business here as he died years before
Al-Rashid was born. The tale begins like that of Ibn Mansur
and the Lady Budur (Night cccxxvii.), except that Mansur does
not offer his advice.

[FN#127] Arab. "Halumma," an interjection=bring! a congener of
the Heb. "Halum"; the grammarians of Kufah and Bassorah are
divided concerning its origin.

[FN#128] Arab. "Nafs-i" which here corresponds with our
canting "the flesh" the "Old Adam," &c.

[FN#129] Arab. "Atmari" used for travel. The Anglo-Americans
are the only people who have the common sense to travel (where
they are not known) in their "store clothes" and reserve the
worst for where they are known.

[FN#130] e.g. a branch or bough.

[FN#131] Arab. "Rayah kaimah," which Lane translates a "beast
standing"!

[FN#132] Tying up the near foreleg just above the knee; and
even with this a camel can hop over sundry miles of ground in
the course of a night. The hobbling is shown in Lane. (Nights
vol. ii., p. 46.)

[FN#133] As opposed to "Severance" in the old knightly
language of love, which is now apparently lost to the world. I
tried it in the Lyrics of Camoens and found that I was
speaking a forgotten tongue, which mightily amused the common
sort of critic and reviewer. 

[FN#134] More exactly three days and eight hours, after which
the guest becomes a friend, and as in the Argentine prairies
is expected to do friend's duty. The popular saying is, "The
entertainment of a guest is three days; the viaticum (jaizah)
is a day and a night, and whatso exceedeth this is alms."

[FN#135] Arab. "'Ashirah." Books tell us there are seven
degrees of connection among the Badawin: Sha'ab, tribe or
rather race; nation (as the Anazah) descended from a common
ancestor; Kabilah the tribe proper (whence les Kabyles);
Fasilah (sept), Imarah; Ashirah (all a man's connections);
Fakhiz (lit. the thigh, i.e., his blood relations) and Batn
(belly) his kith and kin. Practically Kabilah is the tribe,
Ashirah the clan, and Bayt the household; while Hayy may be
anything between tribe and kith and kin.

[FN#136] This is the true platonic love of noble Arabs, the
Ishk 'uzri, noted in vol. ii., 104.

[FN#137] Arab. "'Ala raghm," a favourite term. It occurs in
theology; for instance, when the Shi'ahs are asked the cause
of such and such a ritual distinction they will reply, "Ala
raghmi 'l-Tasannun": lit.=to spite the Sunnis.

[FN#138] In the text "Al-Kaus" for which Lane and Payne
substitute a shield. The bow had not been mentioned but--
n'importe, the Arab reader would say. In the text it is left
at home because it is a cowardly, far-killing weapon compared
with sword and lance. Hence the Spaniard calls and justly
calls the knife the "bravest of arms" as it wants a man behind
it.

[FN#139] Arab. "Rahim" or "Rihm"=womb, uterine relations, pity
or sympathy, which may here be meant.

[FN#140] Reciting Fatihahs and so forth, as I have described
in the Cemetery of Al-Medinah (ii. 300). Moslems do not pay
for prayers to benefit the dead like the majority of
Christendom and, according to Calvinistic Wahhabi-ism, their
prayers and blessings are of no avail. But the mourner's heart
loathes reason and he prays for his dead instinctively like
the so-termed "Protestant." Amongst the latter, by the bye, I
find four great Sommites, (1) Paul of Tarsus who protested
against the Hebraism of Peter; (2) Mohammed who protested
against the perversions of Christianity; (3) Luther who
protested against Italian rule in Germany, and lastly (4) one
(who shall be nameless) that protests against the whole
business.

[FN#141] Lane transfers this to vol. i. 520 (notes to chapt.
vii); and gives a mere abstract as of that preceding.

[FN#142] We learn from Ibn Batutah that it stood South of the
Great Mosque and afterwards became the Coppersmiths' Bazar.
The site was known as Al-Khazra (the Green) and the building
was destroyed by the Abbasides. See Defremery and Sanguinetti,
i. 206.

[FN#143] This great tribe or rather nation has been noticed
before (vol. ii. 170). The name means "Strong," and derives
from one Tamim bin Murr of the race of Adnan, nat. circ. A.D.
121. They hold the North-Eastern uplands of Najd, comprising
the great desert Al-Dahna and extend to Al-Bahrayn. They are
split up into a multitude of clans and septs; and they can
boast of producing two famous sectarians. One was Abdullah bin
Suffar, head of the Suffriyah; and the other Abdullah bin Ibaz
(Ibadh) whence the Ibaziyah heretics of Oman who long included
her princes. Mr. Palgrave wrongly writes Abadeeyah and
Biadeeyah and my "Bayazi" was an Arab vulgarism used by the
Zanzibarians. Dr. Badger rightly prefers Ibaziyah which he
writes Ibadhiyah (Hist. of the Imams, etc.).

[FN#144] Governor of Al-Medinah under Mu'awiyah and afterwards
(A.H. 64-65=683-4) fourth Ommiade. Al-Siyuti (p. 216) will not
account him amongst the princes of the Faithful, holding him a
rebel against Al-Zubayr. Ockley makes Ibn al-Zubayr ninth and
Marwan tenth Caliph.

[FN#145] The address, without the vocative particle, is more
emphatic; and the P.N. Mu'awiyah seems to court the omission.

[FN#146] This may also mean that the œ500 were the woman's
"mahr" or marriage dowry and the œ250 a present to buy the
father's consent.

[FN#147] Quite true to nature. See an account of the quasi-
epileptic fits to which Syrians are subject and by them called
Al-Wahtah in "The Inner Life of Syria," i. 233.

[FN#148] Arab. "Wayha-k" here equivalent to Wayla-k. M. C.
Barbier de Meynard renders the first "mon ami" and the second
"miserable."

[FN#149] This is an instance when the article (Al) is
correctly used with one proper name and not with another. Al-
Kumayt (P. N. of poet) lit. means a bay horse with black
points: Nasr is victory.

[FN#150] This anecdote, which reads like truth, is ample set-
off for a cart-load of abuse of women. But even the Hindu,
determined misogynists in books, sometimes relent. Says the
Katha Sarit Sagara: "So you see, King, honourable matrons are
devoted to their husbands, and it is not the case that all
women are always bad" (ii. 624). Let me hope that after all
this Mistress Su'ad did not lead her husband a hardish life.

[FN#151] Al-Khali'a has been explained in vol. i. 311 {Vol 1,
FN#633}:  the translation of Al-Mas'udi (vi. 10) renders it
"scelerat." Abu Ali al-Husayn the Wag was a Bassorite and a
worthy companion of Abu Nowas the Debauchee; but he adorned
the Court of Al-Amin the son not of Al-Rashid the father.

[FN#152] Governor of Bassorah, but not in Al-Husayn's day

[FN#153] The famous market-place where poems were recited,
mentioned by Al-Hariri.

[FN#154] A quarter of Bassorah.

[FN#155] Capital of Al-Yaman, and then famed for its leather
and other work (vol. v. 16).

[FN#156] The creases in the stomach like the large navel are
always insisted upon. Says the Katha (ii. 525) "And he looked
on that torrent river of the elixir of beauty, adorned with a
waist made charming by those wave-like wrinkles," etc.

[FN#157] Arab. Sabaj (not Sabah, as the Mac. Edit. misprints
it): I am not sure of its meaning. 

[FN#158] A truly Arab conceit, suggesting 

     The music breathing from her face;

her calves moved rhythmically, suggesting the movement and
consequent sound of a musical instrument.

[FN#159] The morosa voluptas of the Catholic divines. The
Sapphist described in the text would procure an orgasm (in
gloria, as the Italians call it) by biting and rolling over
the girl she loved; but by loosening the trouser-string she
evidently aims at a closer tribadism the Arab " Musahikah."

[FN#160] We drink (or drank) after dinner, Easterns before the
meal and half-Easterns (like the Russians) before and after.
We talk of liquor being unwholesome on an empty stomach; but
the truth is that all is purely habit. And as the Russian
accompanies his Vodka with caviare, etc., so the Oriental
drinks his Raki or Mahaya (Ma al-hayat=aqua vitae) alternately
with a Salatah, for whose composition see Pilgrimage i. 198.
The Eastern practice has its advantages: it awakens the
appetite, stimulates digestion and, what Easterns greatly
regard, it is economical; half a bottle doing the work of a
whole. Bhang and Kusumba (opium dissolved and strained through
a pledges of cotton) are always drunk before dinner and thus
the "jolly" time is the preprandial, not the postprandial.

[FN#161] "Abu al-Sakha" (pronounced Abussakha) = Father of
munificence.

[FN#162] 'Arab. "Shammara," also used for gathering up the
gown, so as to run the faster.

[FN#163] i.e., blessing the Prophet and all True Believers
(herself included).

[FN#164] The style of this letter is that of a public scribe
in a Cairo market-place thirty years ago.

[FN#165] i.e.. she could not help falling in love with this
beauty of a man.

[FN#166] "Kudrat," used somewhat in the sense of our vague
"Providence." The sentence means, leave Omnipotence to manage
him. Mr. Redhouse, who forces a likeness between Moslem and
Christian theology, tells us that "Qader is unjustly
translated by Fate and Destiny, an old pagan idea abhorrent to
Al-Islam which reposes on God's providence." He makes Kaza and
Kismet quasi-synonymes of "Qaza" and "Qader," the former
signifying God's decree, the latter our allotted portion, and
he would render both by dispensation. Of course it is
convenient to forget the Guarded Tablet of the learned and the
Night of Power and skull-lectures of the vulgar. The eminent
Turkish scholar would also translate Salat by worship (du'a
being prayer) because it signifies a simple act of adoration
without entreaty. If he will read the Opener of the Koran,
recited in every set of prayers, he will find an especial
request to be "led to the path which is straight." These
vagaries are seriously adopted by Mr. E. J. W. Gibb in his
Ottoman Poems (p. 245, etc.) London: Trubner and Co., 1882;
and they deserve, I think, reprehension, because they serve
only to mislead; and the high authority of the source whence
they come necessarily recommends them to many.

[FN#167] The reader will have noticed the likeness of this
tale to that of Ibn Mansur and the Lady Budur (vol. iv., 228
et seq.){Vol 4, Tale 42} For this reason Lane leaves it
untranslated (iii. 252).

[FN#168] Lane also omits this tale (iii. 252). See Night
dclxxxviii.
