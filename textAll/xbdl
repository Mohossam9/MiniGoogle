 but she
wouldn't.  Evidently she had set her heart on helping you and the
child.  It is too bad, because, practically speaking, we owe
everything to her.  There is little doubt that the inquiry set on
foot by her scared the Thomas fellow into flight.  And she has
worked night and day to aid us.  She is a very clever woman,
Captain Whittaker, and a good one.  You can't thank her enough.
Here! what are you about?"

Captain Cy strode past him into the dining room.  The hat rack hung
on the wall by the side door.  He snatched his cap from the peg,
and was struggling into his overcoat.

"Where are you going?" demanded the lawyer.  "You mustn't attempt to
walk now.  You need rest."

"Rest!  I'll rest by and by.  Just now I've got business to attend
to.  Let go of that pea-jacket."

"But--"

"No buts about it.  I'll see you later.  So long."

He threw open the door and hurried down the walk.  The lawyer
watched him in amazement.  Then a slow smile overspread his face.

"Captain," he called.  "Captain Whittaker."

Captain Cy looked back over his shoulder.  "What do you want?" he
asked.

Mr. Peabody's face was now intensely solemn, but there was a
twinkle in his eye.

"I think she's at the boarding house," he said demurely.  "I'm
pretty certain you'll find her there."

All the regulars at the perfect boarding house had, of course,
attended the reception at the Cy Whittaker place.  None of them,
with the exception of the schoolmistress, had as yet returned.
Dinner had been forgotten in the excitement of the great day, and
Keturah and Angeline and Mrs. Tripp had stopped in at various
dwellings along the main road, to compare notes on the captain's
appearance and the Atkins address.  Asaph and Bailey and Alpheus
Smalley were at Simmons's.

Captain Cy knew better than to attempt his hurried trip by way of
the road.  He had no desire to be held up and congratulated.  He
went across lots, in the rear of barns and orchards, wading through
drifts and climbing fences as no sane convalescent should.  But the
captain at that moment was suffering from the form of insanity
known as the fixed idea.  She had done all this for him--for HIM.
And his last message to her had been an insult.

He approached the Bangs property by the stable lane.  No one locks
doors in our village, and those of the perfect boarding house were
unfastened.  He entered by way of the side porch, just as he had
done when Gabe Lumley's depot wagon first deposited him in that
yard.  But now he entered on tiptoe.  The dining room was empty.
He peeped into the sitting room.  There, by the center table, sat
Phoebe Dawes, her elbow on the arm of her chair, and her head
resting on her hand.

"Ahem!  Phoebe!" said Captain Cy.

She started, turned, and saw him standing there.  Her eyes were
wet, and there was a handkerchief in her lap.

"Phoebe," said the captain anxiously, "have you been cryin'?"

She rose on the instant.  A great wave of red swept over her face.
The handkerchief fell to the floor, and she stooped and picked it
up.

"Crying?" she repeated confusedly.  "Why, no, of course--of course
not!  I--  How do you do, Captain Whittaker?  I'm--we're all very
glad to see you home again--and well."

She extended her hand.  Captain Cy reached forward to take it; then
he hesitated.

"I don't think I'd ought to let you shake hands with me, Phoebe,"
he said.  "Not until I beg your pardon."

"Beg my pardon?  Why?"

He absently took the hand and held it.

"For the word I sent to you when I went away.  'Twas an awful thing
to say, but I meant it for your sake, you know.  Honest, I did."

She laughed nervously.

"Oh! that," she said.  "Well, I did think you were rather particular
as to your visitors.  But Mr. Tidditt explained, and then--  You
needn't beg my pardon.  I appreciate your thoughtfulness.  I knew
you meant to be kind to me."

"That's what I did.  But you didn't obey orders.  You kept comin'.
Now, why--"

"Why?  Did you suppose that _I_ cared for the malicious gossip of--
such people?  I came because you were in trouble, and I hoped to
help you.  And--and I thought I had helped, until a few minutes
ago."

Her lip quivered.  That quiver went to the captain's heart.

"Helped?" he faltered.  "Helped?  Why, you've done so much that I
can't ever thank you.  You've been the only real helper I've had in
all this miserable business.  You've stood by me all through."

"But it was all wrong.  He isn't the man at all.  Didn't Mr.
Peabody tell you?"

"Yes, yes, he told me.  What difference does that make?  Peabody be
hanged!  He ain't in this.  It's you and me--don't you see?  What
made you do all this for me?"

She looked at the floor and not at him as she answered.

"Why, because I wanted to help you," she said.  "I've been alone in
the world ever since mother died, years ago.  I've had few real
friends.  Your friendship had come to mean a great deal to me.  The
splendid fight you were making for that little girl proved what a
man you were.  And you fought so bravely when almost everyone was
against you, I couldn't help wanting to do something for you.  How
could I?  And now it has come to nothing--my part of it.  I'm so
sorry."

"It ain't, neither.  It's come to everything.  Phoebe, I didn't
mean to say very much more than to beg your pardon when I headed
for here.  But I've got to--I've simply got to.  This can't go on.
I can't have you keep comin' to see me--and Bos'n.  I can't keep
meetin' you every day.  I CAN'T."

She looked up, as if to speak, but something, possibly the
expression in his face, caused her to look quickly down again.
She did not answer.

"I can't do it," continued the captain desperately.  "'Tain't for
what folks might say.  They wouldn't say much when I was around, I
tell you.  It ain't that.  It's because I can't bear to have you
just a friend.  Either you must be more'n that, or--or I'll have to
go somewheres else.  I realized that when I was in Washin'ton and
cruisin' to California and back.  I've either got to take Bos'n and
go away for good, or--or--"

She would not help him.  She would not speak.

"You see?" he groaned.  "You see, Phoebe, what an old fool I am.
I can't ask you to marry me, me fifty-five, and rough from knockin'
round the world, and you, young and educated, and a lady.  I ain't
fool enough to ask such a thing as that.  And yet, I couldn't stay
here and meet you every day, and by and by see you marry somebody
else.  By the big dipper, I couldn't do it!  So that's why I can't
shake hands with you to-day--nor any more, except when I say good-
by for keeps."

Then she looked up.  The color was still bright in her face, and
her eyes were moist, but she was smiling.

"Can't shake hands with me?" she said.  "Please, what have you been
doing for the last five minutes?"

Captain Cy dropped her hand as if his own had been struck with
paralysis.

"Good land!" he stammered.  "I didn't know I did it; honest truth,
I didn't."

Phoebe's smile was still there, faint, but very sweet.

"Why did you stop?" she queried.  "I didn't ask you to."

"Why did I stop?  Why, because I--I--I declare I'm ashamed--"

She took his hand and clasped it with both her own.

"I'm not," she said bravely, her eyes brightening as the wonder and
incredulous joy grew in his.  "I'm very proud.  And very, very
happy."



There was to be a big supper at the Cy Whittaker place that night.
It was an impromptu affair, arranged on the spur of the moment by
Captain Cy, who, in spite of the lawyer's protests and anxiety
concerning his health, went serenely up and down the main road,
inviting everybody he met or could think of.  The captain's face
was as radiant as a spring sunrise.  His smile, as Asaph said,
"pretty nigh cut the upper half of his head off."  People who had
other engagements, and would, under ordinary circumstances, have
refused the invitation, couldn't say no to his hearty, "Can't come?
Course you'll come!  Man alive!  I WANT you."

"Invalid, is he?" observed Josiah Dimick, after receiving and
accepting his own invitation.  "Well, I wish to thunder I could be
took down with the same kind of disease.  I'd be willin' to linger
along with it quite a spell if it pumped me as full of joy as Whit
seems to be.  Don't give laughin' gas to keep off pneumonia, do
they?  No?  Well, I'd like to know the name of his medicine, that's
all."

Supper was to be ready at six.  Georgianna, assisted by Keturah
Bangs, Mrs. Sylvanus Cahoon, and other volunteers, was gloriously
busy in the kitchen.  The table in the dining room reached from one
end of the big apartment to the other.  Guests would begin to
arrive shortly.  Wily Mr. Peabody, guessing that Captain Cy might
prefer to be alone, had taken the Board of Strategy out riding
behind the span.

In the sitting room, around the baseburner stove, were three
persons--Captain Cy, Bos'n, and Phoebe.  Miss Dawes had "come
early," at the captain's urgent appeal.  Now she was sitting in the
rocker, at one side of the stove, gazing dreamily at the ruddy
light behind the isinglass panes.  She looked quietly, blissfully
contented and happy.  At her feet, on the braided mat, sat Bos'n,
playing with Lonesome, who purred lazily.  The little girl was
happy, too, for was not her beloved Uncle Cyrus at home again, with
all danger of their separation ended forevermore?

As for Captain Cy himself, the radiant expression was still on his
face, brighter than ever.  He looked across at Phoebe, who smiled
back at him.  Then he glanced down at Bos'n.  And all at once he
realized that this was the fulfillment of his dream.  Here was his
"picture"; the sitting room was now as he had always loved to think
of it--as it used to be.  He was in his father's chair, Phoebe in
the one his mother used to occupy, and between them--just where he
had sat so often when a boy--the child.  The Cy Whittaker place had
again, and at last, come into its own.

He drew a long breath, and looked about the room; at the stove, the
lamp, the old, familiar furniture, at his grandfather's portrait
over the mantel.  Then, in a flash of memory, his father's words
came back to him, and he said, laughing aloud from pure happiness:

"Bos'n, run down cellar and get me a pitcher of cider, won't you?--
there's a good feller."

                   The Translator's Foreword.


  
The peculiar proceedings of the Curators, Bodleian Library, 1
Oxford, of which full particulars shall be given in due time,
have dislocated the order of my volumes. The Prospectus had
promised that Tome III. should contain detached extracts from the
MS. known as the Wortley-Montague, and that No. IV. and part of
No. V. should comprise a reproduction of the ten Tales (or
eleven, including "The Princess of Daryabar"), which have so long
been generally attributed to Professor Galland. Circumstances,
however, wholly beyond my control have now compelled me to devote
the whole of this volume to the Frenchman's stories.

It will hardly be doubted that for a complete recueil of The
Nights a retranslation of the Gallandian histoires is necessary.
The learned Professor Gustav Weil introduced them all, Germanised
literally from the French, into the Dritter Band of his
well-known version--Tausend und eine Nacht; and not a few readers
of Mr. John Payne's admirable translation (the Villon) complained
that they had bought it in order to see Ali Baba, Aladdin, and
others translated into classical English and that they much
regretted the absence of their old favourites.

But the modus operandi was my prime difficulty. I disliked the
idea of an unartistic break or change in the style, ever

          "Tachnat de rendre mien cet air d'antiquite,"

and I aimed at offering to my readers a homogeneous sequel. My
first thought for securing uniformity of treatment was to tender
the French text into Arabic, and then to retranslate it into
English. This process, however, when tried was found wanting; so
I made inquiries in all directions for versions of the Gallandian
histories which might have been published in Persian, Turkish, or
Hindustani. Though assisted by the Prince of London Bibliopoles,
Bernard Quaritch, I long failed to find my want: the vernaculars
in Persian and Turkish are translated direct from the Arabic
texts, and all ignore the French stories. At last a friend,
Cameron McDowell, himself well known to the world of letters,
sent me from Bombay a quaint lithograph with quainter
illustrations which contained all I required. This was a version
of Totaram Shayan (No. III.), which introduced the whole of the
Gallandian Tales: better still, these were sufficiently
orientalised and divested of their inordinate Gallicism,
especially their lonesome dialogue, by being converted into
Hindustani, the Urdu Zaban (camp or court language) of Upper
India and the Lingua Franca of the whole Peninsula.

During one of my sundry visits to the British Museum, I was
introduced by Mr. Alexander G. Ellis to Mr. James F. Blumhardt,
of Cambridge, who pointed out to me two other independent
versions, one partly rhymed and partly in prose.

Thus far my work was done for me. Mr. Blumhardt, a practical
Orientalist and teacher of the modem Prakrit tongues, kindly
undertook, at my request, to English the Hindustani, collating at
the same time, the rival versions; and thus, at a moment when my
health was at its worst, he saved me all trouble and labour
except that of impressing the manner with my own sign manual, and
of illustrating the text, where required, with notes
anthropological and other.

Meanwhile, part of my plan was modified by a visit to Paris in
early 1887. At the Bibliotheque Nationale I had the pleasure of
meeting M. Hermann Zotenberg, keeper of Eastern manuscripts, an
Orientalist of high and varied talents, and especially famous for
his admirable Chronique de Tabari. Happily for me, he had lately
purchased for the National Library, from a vendor who was utterly
ignorant of its history, a MS. copy of The Nights, containing the
Arabic originals of Zayn al-Asnam and Alaeddin. The two volumes
folio are numbered and docketed Supplement Arabe, Nos. 2522-23;"
they measure 31 cent. by 20; Vol. i. contains 411 folios (822
pages) and Vol. ii. 402 (pp. 804); each page numbers fifteen
lines, and each folio has its catchword. The paper is French,
English and Dutch, with four to five different marks, such as G.
Gautier; D. and C. Blaew; Pro Patra and others. The highly
characteristic writing, which is the same throughout the two
folios, is easily recognised as that of Michel (Mikhail) Sabbagh,
the Syrian, author of the Colombe Messagere, published in Paris
A.D. 1805, and accompanied by a translation by the celebrated
Silvestre de Sacy (Chrestomathie iii. 365). This scribe also
copied, about 1810, for the same Orientalist, the Ikhwan al-Safa.

I need say nothing more concerning this MS., which M. Zotenberg
purposes to describe bibliographically in volume xxviii. of
Notices et extraits des Manuscrits de la Bibliotheque rationale
publies par l'Academie des inscriptions et belles lettres. And
there will be a tirage a part of 200-300 copies entitled Histoire
d' 'Ala al-Din ou La Lampe Merveilleuse, Texte Arabe, publie par
H. Zotenberg, Paris, Imprimerie Nationale, 1888; including a most
important contribution:--Sur quelques Manuscrits des Mille et une
Nuits et la traduction de Galland.[FN#1]

The learned and genial author has favoured me with proof sheets
of his labours: it would be unfair to disclose the discoveries,
such as the Manuscript Journals in the Bibliotheque Nationale
(Nos. 15277 to 15280), which the illustrious Garland kept
regularly till the end of his life, and his conversations with
"M. Hanna, Maronite d'Halep," alias Jean Dipi (Dippy, a
corruption of Diab): suffice it to say that they cast a clear and
wholly original light upon the provenance of eight of the
Gallandian histories. I can, however, promise to all
"Aladdinists" a rich harvest of facts which wholly displace those
hitherto assumed to be factual. But for the satisfaction of my
readers I am compelled to quote the colophon of M. Zotenberg's
great "find" (vol. ii.), as it bears upon a highly important
question.

"And the finishing thereof was during the first decade of Jamadi the Second,
of the one thousand and one hundred and fifteenth year of the Hegirah (= A.D.
1703) by the transcription of the neediest of His slaves unto Almighty Allah,
Ahmad bin Mohammed al-Taradi, in Baghdad City: he was a Shafi'i of school, and
a Mosuli by birth, and a Baghdadi by residence, and he wrote it for his own
use, and upon it he imprinted his signet. So Allah save our lord Mohammed and
His Kin and Companions and assain them! Kabikaj."[FN#2]

Now as this date corresponds with A.D. 1703, whereas Galland did
begin publishing until 1705-1705 the original MS. of Ahmad al-
Taradi could not have been translated or adapted from the French;
and although the transcription by Mikhail Sabbagh, writing in
1805-10, may have introduced modification borrowed from Galland,
yet the scrupulous fidelity of his copy, shown by sundry marginal
and other notes, lays the suspicion that changes of importance
have been introduced by him. Remains now only to find the
original codex of Al-Taradi.

I have noticed in my translation sundry passages which appear to
betray the Christian hand; but these are mostly of scanty
consequence in no wise affecting the genuineness of the text.

The history of Zayn al Asnam was copied from the Sabbagh MS. and
sent to me by M. Houdas, Professeur d'Arabe vulgaire a l'Ecole
des langues orientales vivantes; an Arabist, whose name is
favourably quoted in the French Colonies of Northern Africa M.
Zotenberg kindly lent me his own transcription of Alaeddin before
sending it to print; and I can only regret that the dilatory
proceedings of the Imprimerie Nationale, an establishment
supported by the State, and therefore ignoring the trammels of
private industry, have prevented my revising the version now
submitted to the public. This volume then begins with the two
Gallandian Tales, "Zeyn Alasnam" and "Aladdin," whose Arabic
original was discovered by M. Zotenberg during the last year:
although separated in the French version, I have brought them
together for the sake of uniformity. The other eight (or nine,
including the Princess of Daryabar), entitled History of Khudadad
and his Brothers, and the Princess of Daryabar;

History of Khudadad and his Brothers, and the Princess of
Daryabar;
History of the Blind Man, Baba Abdullah;
History of Sidi Nu'uman;
History of Khwajah Hasan al-Habbal;
History of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves;
History of Ali Khwajah and the Merchant of Baghdad;
History of Prince Ahmad and the Fairy Peri-banu;
History of the two Sisters who envied their Cadette,

are borrowed mainly from the Indian version of Totaram Shayan.

And here I must quote the bibliographical notices concerning the
sundry versions into Urdu or Hindustani which have been drawn up
with great diligence by Mr. Blumhardt.

"The earliest attempt to translate the Arabian Nights was made by Munshi Shams
al-Din Ahmad Shirwani. A prose version of the first two hundred Nights made by
him 'for the use of the College at Fort St. George' was lithographed at Madras
in the year A.H. 1252 (A.D. 1836) and published in 8vo volumes (pp. 517, 426)
under the title 'Hikayat ool jaleeah'[FN#3] (Hikayat al-jalilah). The
translation was made from an Arabic original but it does not appear what
edition was made use of. The translator had intended to bring out a version of
the entire work, but states in his preface that, being unable to procure the
Arabic of the other Nights, he could not proceed with the translation, and had
to be content to publish only two hundred Nights. This version does not appear
to have become popular, for no other edition seems to have been published. And
the author must not be confounded with Shaykh Ahmad Shirwani, who, in A.D.
1814, printed an Arabic edition of the Arabian Nights Entertainments
(Calcutta, Pereira) which also stopped at No. CC.

"The next translation was made by Munshi al-Karim, likewise in prose. From the
preface and colophon to this work it appears that 'Abd al-Karim obtained a
copy of Edward Foster's English version of the Arabian Nights, and after two
years' labour completed a translation of the whole work in A.H. 1258 (A.D.
1842). It was lithographed at the Mustafai Press at Kanpur (Cawnpore) in the
year A.H. 1263 (A.D. 1847) and published in four vols., in two royal 8vos,
lithographed; each containing two Jilds (or parts, pp. 276, 274; 214 and 195).

"A second edition appeared from the same press in A.H. 1270 (A.D. 1853) also
in two vols. 8vo of two Jilds each (pp. 249, 245; 192, 176). Since then
several other editions have been published at Cawnpore, at Lakhnau[FN#4] and
also at Bombay. This translation is written in an easy fluent style, omitting
all coarseness of expression or objectionable passages, in language easily
understood, and at the same time in good and elegant Hindustani. It is
therefore extremely popular, and selections from the 4th Jild have been taken
as text books for the Indian Civil Service examinations. A Romanised Urdu
version of the first two Jilds according to Duncan Forbes' system of
transliteration, was made 'under the superintendence of T. W. H. Tolbort,' and
published under the editorship of F. Pincott in London, by W. H. Allen and Co.
in 1882.[FN#5] There has been no attempt to divide this translation into
Nights: there are headings to the several tales and nothing more. To supply
this want, and also to furnish the public with a translation closer to the
original, and one more intelligible to Eastern readers, and in accordance with
Oriental thought and feeling, a third translation was taken in hand by Totaram
Shayan, at the instance of Nawal Kishore, the well-known bookseller and
publisher of Lucknow. The first edition of this translation was lithographed
at Lucknow in the year A.H. 1284 (A.D. 1868) and published in a 4to vol. of
1,080 pages under the title of Hazar Dastan.[FN#6] Totaram Shayan has followed
'Abd al-Karim's arrangement of the whole work into four Jilds, each of which
has a separate pagination (pp. 304; 320, 232, and 224.) The third Jild has 251
Nights: the other three 250 each. The translation is virtually in prose, but
it abounds in snatches of poetry, songs and couplets taken from the writings
of Persian poets, and here and there a verse-rendering of bits of the story.
This translation, though substantially agreeing in the main with that of 'Abd
al-Karim, yet differs widely from it in the treatment. It is full of flowery
metaphors and is written in a rich, ornate style full of Persian and Arabic
words and idioms, which renders it far less easy to understand than the simple
language of 'Abd al-Karim. Some passages have been considerably enlarged and
sometimes contain quite different reading from that of 'Abd al-Karim with
occasional additional matter. In other places descriptions have been much
curtailed so that although the thread of the story may be the same in both
translations it is hard to believe that the two translators worked from the
same version. Unfortunately Totaram Shayan makes no mention at Ali the source
whence he made his translation whether English or Arabic. This translation
reached its fourth edition in 1883, and has been published with the addition
of several badly executed full-page illustrations evidently taken from English
prints.

"Yet another translation of The Nights has been made into Hindustani, and this
a versified paraphrase, the work of three authors whose takhallus or noms de
plume, were as follows: "Nasim" (Muhammad Asghar Ali Khan), translator of the
first Jild, "Shayan" (Totaram Shayan), who undertook the second and third
Jilds, and "Chaman" (Shadi Lal) by whom the fourth and last Jild was
translated. The work is complete in 1,244 pages 4to, and was lithographed at
Lucknow; Jilds i.-iii. in A.H. 1278 (A.D. 1862) and Jild iv. in 1285 (A.D.
1869). This translation is also divided into Nights, differing slightly from
the prose translation of Totaram Shayan, as the first Jild has 251 Nights and
the others 250 each."

And now I have only to end this necessarily diffuse Foreword with
my sincerest thanks to Mr. Clouston, the Storiologist, who has
brought his wide experience of Folk-lore to bear upon the tales
included in my Third Supplemental Volume; and to Dr. Steingass,
who during my absence from England kindly passed my proofs
through the press.

Quoth Dunyazad, "O sister mine, an thou be other than sleepy,
tell us one of thy fair tales, so therewith we may cut short the

love and good will! I will relate to you




                THE TALE OF ZAYN AL-ASNAM.[FN#8]



It hath reached me, O King of the Age, that in
Bassorah-city[FN#9] reigned a puissant Sultan, who was opulent
exceedingly and who owned all the goods of life; but he lacked a
child which might inherit his wealth and dominion. So, being
sorely sorrowful on this account, he arose and fell to doing
abundant alms-deeds to Fakirs and the common poor, to the Hallows
and other holy men and prayed their recourse to Allah Almighty,
in order that the Lord (to whom belong Might and Majesty!) might
of His grace bless him with issue. And the Compassionate accepted
his prayer for his alms to the Religious and deigned grant his
petition; and one night of the nights after he lay with the Queen
she went away from him with child. Now as soon as the Sultan
heard of the conception he rejoiced with exceeding great joyance,
and when the days of delivery drew near he gathered together all
the astrologers and sages who strike the sand-board,[FN#10]and
said to them, "'Tis our desire that ye disclose and acquaint us
anent the birth which is to be born during the present month
whether it shall be male or female, and what shall befal it from
the shifts of Time, and what shall proceed from it." Thereupon
the geomantists struck their sand-boards and the astrophils
ascertained their ascendants and they drew the horoscope of the
babe unborn, and said to the sovran, "O King of the Age and Lord
of the Time and the Tide, verily the child to which the Queen
shall presently give birth will be a boy and 't will be right for
thee to name him Zayn al-Asnam--Zayn of the Images." Then spake
the geomantists, saying, "Know then, Ho though the King, that
this little one shall approve him when grown to man's estate
valiant and intelligent; but his days shall happen upon sundry
troubles and travails, and yet if he doughtily fight against all
occurrence he shall become the most opulent of the Kings of the
World." Exclaimed the Sultan, "An the child approve himself
valorous, as ye have announced, then the toil and moil which
shall be his lot may be held for naught, inasmuch as calamities
but train and strengthen the songs of the Kings."[FN#11] Shortly
after this the Queen gave birth to a man-child, and Glory be to
Him who fashioned the babe with such peerless beauty and
loveliness! The King named his son Zayn al-Asnam, and presently
he became even as the poets sang of one of his fellows in
semblance, 

"He showed; and they cried, 'Be Allah blest!'* And who made him
     and formed him His might attest!
This be surely the lord of all loveliness; * And all others his
     lieges and thralls be confest."

Then Zayn al-Asnam grew up and increased until his age attained
its fifteenth year, when his sire the Sultan appointed for him an
experienced governor, one versed in all the sciences and
philosophies;[FN#12] who fell to instructing him till such times
as he waxed familiar with every branch of knowledge, and in due
season he became an adult. Thereupon the Sultan bade summon his
son and heir to the presence together with the Lords of his land
and the Notables of his lieges and addressed him before them with
excellent counsel saying, "O my son, O Zayn al-Asnam, seeing that
I be shotten in years and at the present time sick of a sickness
which haply shall end my days in this world and which anon shall
seat thee in my stead, therefore, I bequeath unto thee the
following charge. Beware, O my son, lest thou wrong any man, and
incline not to cause the poor complain; but do justice to the
injured after the measure of thy might. Furthermore, have a care
lest thou trust to every word spoken to thee by the Great; but
rather lend thou ever an ear unto the voice of the general; for
that thy Grandees will betray thee as they seek only whatso
suiteth them, not that which suiteth thy subjects." A few days
after this time the old Sultan's distemper increased and his
lifeterm was fulfilled and he died; whereupon his son, Zayn
al-Asnam, arose and donned mourning-dress for his father during
six days; and on the seventh he went forth to the Divan and took
seat upon the throne of his Sultanate. He also held a levee
wherein were assembled all the defenders of the realm, and the
Ministers and the Lords of the land came forward and condoled
with him for the loss of his parent and wished him all good
fortune and gave him joy of his kingship and dominion and prayed
for his endurance in honour and his permanence in prosperity.
--And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and ceased to
say her permitted say.

     When it was the Four Hundred and Ninety-eighth Night,

Quoth Dunyazad, "O sister mine, an thou be other than sleepy,
tell us one of thy fair tales, so therewith we may cut short the
waking hours of this our night;" and quoth Shahrazad:--It hath
reached me, O King of the Age, that Zayn al-Asnam seeing himself
in this high honour and opulence[FN#13] and he young in years and
void of experience, straightway inclined unto lavish expenditure
and commerce with the younglings, who were like him and fell to
wasting immense wealth upon his pleasures; and neglected his
government, nor paid aught of regard to his subjects.[FN#14]
Thereupon the Queen-mother began to counsel him, and forbid him
from such ill courses, advising him to abandon his perverse
inclinations and apply his mind to rule and commandment, and to
further the policy of his kingdom, lest the lieges repudiate him
and rise up against him and depose him. But he would on no wise
hearken to a single of her words and persisted in his ignorant
folly; whereat the folk murmured, inasmuch as the Lords of the
land had put forth their hands to tyranny and oppression when
they saw the King lacking in regard for his Ryots. And presently
the commons rose up against Zayn al-Asnam and would have dealth
harshly with him had not his mother been a woman of wits and
wisdom and contrivance, dearly loved of the general. So she
directed the malcontents aright and promised them every good:
then she summoned her son Zayn al-Asnam and said to him, "Behold,
O my child, that which I foretold for thee, to wit that thou
wastest thy realm and lavishest thy life to boot by persevering
in what ignorance thou art; for that thou hast placed the
governance of thy Kingdom in the hands of inexperienced youth and
hast neglected the elders and hast dissipated thy moneys and the
moneys of the monarchy, and thou hast lavished all thy treasure
upon wilfulness and carnal pleasuring." Zayn al-Asnam, awaking
from the slumber of negligence, forthright accepted his mother's
counsel and, faring forth at once to the Diwan,[FN#15] he
entrusted the management of the monarchy to certain old officers,
men of intelligence and experience. But he acted on this wise
only after Bassorah-town was ruined, inasmuch as he had not
turned away from his ignorant folly before he had wasted and
spoiled all the wealth of the Sultanate, and he had become
utterly impoverished. Thereupon the Prince fell to repenting and
regretting that which had been done by him, until the repose of
sleep was destroyed for him and he shunned meat and drink; nor
did this cease until one night of the nights which had sped in
such grief and thoughtfulness and vain regret until dawn drew
nigh and his eyelids closed for a little while. Then an old and
venerable Shaykh appeared to him in a vision[FN#16] and said to
him, "O Zayn al-Asnam, sorrow not; for after sorrow however sore
cometh naught but joyance; and, would'st thou win free of this
woe, up and hie thee to Egypt where thou shalt find hoards of
wealth which shall replace whatso thou hast wasted and will
double it more than twofold." Now when the Prince was aroused
from his sleep he recounted to his mother all he had seen in his
dream; but his parent began to laugh at him, and he said to her,
"Mock me not: there is no help but that I wend Egypt-wards."
Rejoined she, "O my son, believe not in swevens which be mere
imbroglios of sleep and lying phantasies;" and retorted saying,
"In very sooth my vision is true and the man whom I saw therein
is of the Saints of Allah and his words are veridical." Then on a
night of the nights mounting horse alone and privily, he
abandoned his Kingdom; and took the highway to Egypt; and he rode
day and night until he reached Cairo-city. He entered it and saw
it to be a mighty fine capital; then, tethering his steed he
found shelter in one of its Cathedral-mosques, and he worn out by
weariness; however, when he had rested a little he fared forth
and bought himself somewhat of food. After eating, his excessive
fatigue caused him fall asleep in the mosque; nor had he slept
long ere the Shaykh[FN#17] appeared to him a second time in
vision and said to him, "O Zayn al-Asnam,"--And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. 

      When it was the Four Hundred and Ninety-ninth Night,

Quoth Dunyazad, "O sister mine, an thou be other than sleepy,
tell us one of thy fair tales, so therewith we may cut short the
waking hours of this our night," and quoth Shahrazad:--It hath
reached me, O King of the Age, that the Shaykh again appeared to
the Prince in a vision and said to him, "O Zayn al-Asnam, though
hast obeyed me in whatso I bade thee and I only made trial of
thee to test an thou be valiant or a craven. But now I wot thy
worth, inasmuch as thou hast accepted my words and thou hast
acted upon my advice: so do thou return straightway to thy
capital and I will make thee a wealthy ruler, such an one that
neither before thee was any king like unto thee nor shall any
like unto thee come after thee." Hereat Zayn al-Asnam awoke and
cried "Bismillah,--in the name of Allah, the Compassionating, the
Compassionate--what be this Shaykh who verily persecuted me until
I travelled to Cairo; and I having faith in him and holding that
he was either the Apostle (whom Allah save and assain!) or one of
the righteous Hallows of God; and there is no Majesty and there
is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! By the Lord,
but I did right well in not relating my dream to any save to my
mother, and in warning none of my departure. I had full faith in
this oldster; but now, meseemeth, the man is not of those who
know the Truth (be He extolled and exalted!); so by Allah I will
cast off all confidence in this Shaykh and his doings." With this
resolve the Prince slept that night in the Mosque and on the
morrow took horse and after a few days of strenuous travel
arrived at his capital Bassorah. Herein he entered by night, and
forthright went in to his mother who asked him, "Say me, hast
thou won aught of whatso the Shaykh promised thee?" and he
answered her by acquainting her with all his adventure. Then she
applied her to consoling and comforting him, saying, "Grieve not,
O my son; if Almighty Allah have apportioned unto thee aught thou
shalt obtain it without toil and travail.[FN#18] But I would see
thee wax sensible and wise, abandoning all these courses which
have landed thee in poverty, O my son; and shunning songstresses
and commune with the inexperienced and the society of loose
livers, male and female. All such pleasures as these are for the
sons of the ne'er-do-well, not for the scions of the Kings thy
peers." Herewith Zayn al-Asnam sware an oath to bear in mind all
she might say to him, never to gainsay her commandments, nor
deviate from them a single hair's breadth; to abandon all she
should forbid him, and to fix his thoughts upon rule and
goverance. Then he addrest himself to sleep, and as he slumbered,
the Shaykh appeared to him a third time in vision, and said, "O
Zayn al-Asnam, O thou valorous Prince; this very day, as soon as
thou shalt have shaken off thy drowsiness, I will fulfil my
covenant with thee. So take with thee a pickaxe, and hie to such
a palace of thy sire, and turn up the ground, searching it well
in such a place where thou wilt find that which shall enrich
thee." As soon as the Prince awoke, he hastened to his mother in
huge joy and told her his tale; but she fell again to laughing at
him, and saying, "O my child, indeed this old man maketh mock of
thee and naught else; so get thyself clear of him." But Zayn
al-Asnam replied, "O mother mine, verily this Shaykh is soothfast
and no liar: for the first time he but tried me and now he
proposeth to perform his promise." Whereto his mother, "At all
events, the work is not wearisome; so do thou whatso thou willest
even as he bade thee. Make the trial and Inshallah--God
willing--return to me rejoicing; yet sore I fear lest thou come
back to me and say, 'Sooth thou hast spoken in thy speech, O my
mother!" However Zayn al-Asnam took up a pickaxe and, descending
to that part of the palace where his sire lay entombed, began to
dig and to delve; nor had he worked a long while[FN#19] ere, lo
and behold! there appeared to him a ring bedded in a marble slab.
He removed the stone and saw a ladder-like flight of steps
whereby he descended until he found a huge souterrain all
pillar'd and propped with columns of marble and alabaster. And
when he entered the inner recesses he saw within the cave-like
souterrain a pavilion which bewildered his wits, and inside the
same stood eight jars[FN#20] of green jasper. So he said in his
mind, "What may be these jars and what may be stored
therein?"--And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say.

           When it was the full Five Hundredth Night,

Quoth Dunyazad, "O sister mine, an thou be other than sleepy,
tell us one of thy fair tales, so therewith we may cut short the
waking hours of this our night," and quoth Shahrazad:--It hath
reached me, O King of the Age, that when Zayn al-Asnam saw the
jars, he came forwards and unlidding them found each and every
full of antique[FN#21] golden pieces; so he hent a few in hand
seen and going to his mother gave of them to her saying, "Hast
thou seen, O my mother?" She marvelled at the matter and made
answer, "Beware, O my son, of wasting this wealth as thou
dissipatedst otheraforetime;" whereupon her son sware to her an
oath saying, "Have no care, O my mother, nor be thy heart other
than good before me; and I desire that thou also find
satisfaction in mine actions." Presently she arose and went forth
with him, and the twain descended into the cavern-like souterrain
and entered the pavilion, where the Queen saw that which
wildereth the wits; and she made sure with her own eyes that the
jars were full of gold. But while they enjoyed the spectacle of
the treasure behold, they caught sight of a smaller jar
wondrously wrought in green jasper; so Zayn al-Asnam opened it
and found therein a golden key; whereupon quoth the Queen-mother,
"O my son, needs must this key have some door which it
unlocketh." Accordingly they sought all about the souterrain and
the pavilion to find if there be a door or aught like thereto,
and presently, seeing a wooden lock fast barred, they knew
wherefor the key was intended. Presently the Prince applied it
and opened the lock, whereupon the door of a palace gave
admittance, and when the twain entered they found it more
spacious than the first pavilion and all illumined with a light
which dazed the sight; yet not a wax-candle lit it up nor indeed
was there a recess for lamps. Hereat they marvelled and meditated
and presently they discovered eight images[FN#22] of precious
stones, all seated upon as many golden thrones, and each and
every was cut of one solid piece; and all the stones were pure
and of the finest water and most precious of price. Zayn al-Asnam
was confounded hereat and said to his mother, "Whence could my
sire have obtained all these rare things?" And the twain took
their pleasure in gazing at them and considering them and both
wondered to see a ninth throne unoccupied, when the Queen espied
a silken hanging whereon was inscribed, "O my son, marvel not at
this mighty wealth which I have acquired by sore stress and
striving travail. But learn also that there existeth a Ninth
Statue whose value is twenty-fold greater than these thou seest
and, if thou would win it, hie thee again to Cairo-city. There
thou shalt find a whilome slave of mine Mubarak[FN#23] hight and
he will take thee and guide thee to the Statue; and 'twill be
easy to find him on entering Cairo: the first person thou shalt
accost will point out the house to thee, for that Mubarak is
known throughout the place." When Zayn al-Asnam had read this
writ he cried: "O my mother, 'tis again my desire to wend my way
Cairo-wards and seek out this image; so do thou say how seest
thou my vision, fact or fiction, after thou assuredst me saying,
'This be an imbroglio of sleep?' However, at all events, O my
mother, now there is no help for it but that I travel once more
to Cairo." Replied she, "O my child, seeing that thou be under
the protection of the Apostle of Allah (whom may He save and
assain!) so do thou fare in safety, while I and thy Wazir will
order thy reign in thine absence till such time as thou shalt
return." Accordingly the Prince went forth and gat him ready and
rode on till he reached Cairo where he asked for Mubarak's house.
The folk answered him saying, "O my lord, this be a man than whom
none is wealthier or greater in boon deeds and bounties, and his
home is ever open to the stranger." Then they showed him the way
and he followed it till he came to Mubarak's mansion where he
knocked at the door and a slave of the black slaves opened to
him.--And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and ceased
to say her permitted say.

         When it was the Five Hundred and First Night, 

Quoth Dunyazad, "O sister mine, an thou be other than sleepy,
tell us one of thy fair tales, so therewith we may cut short the
waking hours of this our night;" and quoth Shahrazad:--It hath
reached me, O King of the Age, that Zayn al-Asnam knocked at the
door when a slave of Mubarak's black slaves came out to him and
opening asked him, "Who[FN#24] art thou and what is it thou
wantest?" The Prince answered, "I am a foreigner from a far
country, and I have heard of Mubarak thy lord that he is famed
for liberality and generosity; so that I come hither purposing to
become his guest." Thereupon the chattel went in to his lord and,
after reporting the matter to him, came out and said to Zayn
al-Asnam, "O my lord, a blessing hath descended upon us by thy
footsteps. Do thou enter, for my master Mubarak awaiteth thee."
Therewith the Prince passed into a court spacious exceedingly and
all beautified with trees and waters, and the slave led him to
the pavilion wherein Mubarak was sitting. As the guest came in
the host straightway rose up and met him with cordial greeting
and cried, "A benediction hath alighted upon us and this night is
the most benedight of the nights by reason of thy coming to us!
So who are thou, O youth, and whence is thine arrival and whither
is thine intent?" He replied, "I am Zayn al-Asnam and I seek one
Mubarak, a slave of the Sultan of Bassorah who deceased a year
ago, and I am his son." Mubarak rejoined, "What sayest thou? Thou
the son of the King of Bassorah?" and the other retorted, "Yea,
verily I am his son."[FN#25] Quoth Mubarak, "In good sooth my
late lord the King of Bassorah left no son known to me! But what
may be thine age, O youth?" "Twenty years or so," quoth the
Prince, presently adding, "But thou, how long is it since thou
leftest my sire?" "I left him eighteen years ago," said the
other; "but, O my shild Zayn al-Asnam, by what sign canst thou
assure me of thy being the son of my old master, the Sovran of
Bassorah?" Said the Prince, "Thou alone knowest that my father
laid out beneath his palace a souterrain,[FN#26] and in this he
placed forty jars of the finest green jasper, which he filled
with pieces of antique gold, also that within a pavilion he
builded a second palace and set therein eight images of precious
stones, each one of a single gem, and all seated upon royal seats
of placer-gold.[FN#27] He also wrote upon a silken hanging a writ
which I read and which bade me repair to thee and thou wouldst
inform me concerning the Ninth Statue whereabouts it may be,
assuring me that it is worth all the eight." Now when Mubarak
heard these words, he fell at the feet of Zayn al-Asnam and
kissed them exclaiming, "Pardon me, O my lord, in very truth thou
art the son of my old master;" adding, presently, "I have spread,
O my lord, a feast[FN#28] for all the Grandess of Cairo and I
would that thy Highness honour it by thy presence." The Prince
replied, "With love and the best will." Thereupon Mubarak arose
and forewent Zayn al-Asnam to the saloon which was full of the
Lords of the land there gathered together, and here he seated
himself after stablishing Zayn al-Asnam in the place of honour.
Then he bade the tables be spread and the feast be served and he
waited upon the Prince with arms crossed behind his back[FN#29]
and at times falling upon his knees. So the Grandees of Cairo
marvelled to see Mubarak, one of the great men of the city,
serving the youth and wondered with extreme wonderment, unknowing
whence the stranger was.--And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn
of day and ceased to say her permitted say. 

        When it was the Five Hundred and Second Night, 

Quoth Dunyazad, "O sister mine, an thou be other than sleepy,
tell us one of thy fair tales, so therewith we may cut short the
waking hours of this our night," and quoth Shahrazad:--It hath
reached me, O King of the Age, that Mubarak fell to waiting upon
Zayn al-Asnam the son of his old lord, and the Grandees of Cairo
there sitting marvelled to see Mubarak, one of the great men of
the city, serving the youth and wondered with extreme wonderment,
unknowing whence the stranger was. After this they ate and drank
and supped well and were cheered till at last Mubarak turned
towards them and said, "O folk, admire not that I wait upon this
young man with all worship and honour, for that he is the son of
my old lord, the Sultan of Bassorah, who bought me with his money
and who died without manumitting me. I am, therefore, bound to do
service to his son, this my young lord, and all that my hand
possesseth of money and munition belongeth to him nor own I aught
thereof at all, at all." When the Grandees of Cairo heard these
words, they stood up before Zayn al-Asnam and salamed to him with
mighty great respect and entreated him with high regard and
blessed him. Then said the Prince, "O assembly, I am in the
presence of your worships, and be ye my witnesses. O Mubarak,
thou art now freed and all thou hast of goods, gold and gear erst
belonging to us becometh henceforth thine own and thou art
endowed with them for good each and every. Eke do thou ask whatso
of importance thou wouldst have from me, for I will on no wise
let or stay thee in thy requiring it." With this Mubarak arose
and kissed the hand of Zayn al-Asnam and thanked him for his
boons, saying, "O my lord, I wish for thee naught save thy weal,
but the wealth that is with me is altogether overmuch for my
wants." Then the Prince abode with the Freedman four days, during
which all the Grandees of Cairo made act of presence day by day
to offer their salams as soon as they heard men say, "This is the
master of Mubarak and the monarch of Bassorah." And whenas the
guest had taken his rest he said to his host, "O Mubarak, my
tarrying with thee hath been long; whereto said the other, "Thou
wottest, O my lord, that the matter whereinto thou comest to
enquire is singular-rare, but that it also involveth risk of
death, and I know not if thy valour can make the attainment
thereto possible to thee." Rejoined Zayn al-Asnam, "Know, O
Mubarak, that opulence is gained only by blood; nor cometh aught
upon mankind save by determination and predestination of the
Creator (be He glorified and magnified!); so look to thine own
stoutness of heart and take thou no thought of me." Thereupon
Mubarak forthright bade his slaves get them ready for wayfare; so
they obeyed his bidding in all things and mounted horse and
travelled by light and dark over the wildest of wolds, every day
seeing matters and marvels which bewildered their wits, sights
they had never seen in all their years, until they drew near unto
a certain place. There the party dismounted and Mubarak bade the
negro slaves and eunuchs abide on the spot saying to them, "Do ye
keep watch and ward over the beasts of burthen and the horses
until what time we return to you." After this the twain set out
together afoot and quoth the Freedman to the Prince, "O my lord,
here valiancy besitteth, for that now thou art in the land of the
Image[FN#30] thou camest to seek." And they ceased not walking
till they reached a lake, a long water and a wide, where quoth
Mubarak to his companion, "Know, O my lord, that anon will come
to us a little craft bearing a banner of azure tinct and all its
planks are of chaunders and lign-al
