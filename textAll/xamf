e his eyes whole again?" Replied the
Wazir, "As my head liveth, an thou cure him, I will spare thy
life and give thee leave to crave a boon of me!" And Nur al-Din
said, "O my lord, bid my hands be unbound!" So the Wazir bade
unbind him and he rose and taking virgin glass,[FN#554] brayed it
and mixed it with unslaked lime and a menstruum of onion-juice.
Then he applied the whole to the horse's eyes and bound them up,
saying in himself, "Now will his eyes be put out and they will
slay me and I shall be at rest from this woe-full life." Then he
passed the night with a heart free from the uncertainty[FN#555]
of cark and care, humbling himself to Allah the Most High and
saying, "O Lord, in Thy knowledge is that which dispenseth with
asking and craving!" Now when the morning morrowed and the sun
shone, the Wazir came to the stable and, loosing the bandage from
the horse's eyes considered them and found them finer than
before, by the ordinance of the King who openeth evermore. So he
said to Nur al-Din, "O Moslem, never in the world saw I the like
of thee for the excellence of thy knowledge. By the virtue of the
Messiah and the Faith which is no liar, thou makest me with
wonder to admire, for all the farriers of our land have failed to
heal this horse!" Then he went up to Nur al-Din and, doing off
his shackles with his own hand, clad him in a costly dress and
made him his master of the Horse; and he appointed him stipends
and allowances and lodged him in a story over the stables. So Nur
al-Din abode awhile, eating and drinking and making merry and
bidding and forbidding those who tended the horses; and whoso
neglected or failed to fodder those tied up in the stable wherein
was his service, he would thrown down and beat with grievous
beating and lay him by the legs in bilboes of iron. Furthermore,
he used every day to descend and visit the stallions and rub them
down with his own hand, by reason of that which he knew of their
value in the Wazir's eyes and his love for them; wherefore the
Minister rejoiced in him with joy exceeding and his breast
broadened and he was right glad, unknowing what was to be the
issue of his case. Now in the new palace, which the one-eyed
Wazir had bought for Princess Miriam, was a lattice-window
overlooking his old house and the flat wherein Nur al-Din lodged.
The Wazir had a daughter, a virgin of extreme loveliness, as she
were a fleeing gazelle or a bending branchlet, and it chanced
that she sat one day at the lattice aforesaid and behold, she
heard Nur al-Din, singing and solacing himself under his sorrows
by improvising these verses, 

"O my Censor who wakest a-morn to see * The joys of life and its
     jubilee! 
Had the fangs of Destiny bitten thee * In such bitter case thou
     hadst pled this plea,
     'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me:
     My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'
But from Fate's despight thou art safe this day;- * From her
     falsest fay and her crying 'Nay!'
Yet blame him not whom his woes waylay * Who distraught shall say
     in his agony,
     'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me: 
     My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'
Excuse such lovers in flight abhorr'd * Nor to Love's distreses
     thine aid afford:
Lest thy self be bound by same binding cord * And drink of Love's
     bitterest injury. 
     'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me:
     My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'
In His service I wont as the days went by * With freest heart
     through the nights to lie; 
Nor tasted wake, nor of Love aught reckt * Ere my heart to
     subjection summoned he:
     'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me:
     My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'
None weet of Love and his humbling wrong * Save those he sickened
     so sore, so long,
Who have lost their wits 'mid the lover-throng * Draining
     bitterest cup by his hard decree:
     'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me:
     My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'
How oft in Night's gloom he cause wake to rue * Lovers' eyne, and
     from eyelids their sleep withdrew; 
Till tears to the railing of torrents grew, * Overflowing cheeks
    , unconfined and free:
     'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me:
     My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'
How many a man he has joyed to steep * In pain, and for pine hath
     he plundered sleep,--
Made don garb of mourning the deepest deep * And even his
     dreaming forced to flee:
     'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me:
     My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'
How oft sufferance fails me! How bones are wasted * And down my
     cheeks torrent tear-drops hasted: 
And embittered She all the food I tasted * However sweet it was
     wont to be:
     'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me:
     My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'
Most hapless of men who like me must love, * And must watch when
     Night droops her wing from above,
Who, swimming the main where affection drove * Must sign and sink
     in that gloomy sea:
     'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me:
     My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'
Who is he to whom Love e'er stinted spite * And who scaped his
     springes and easy sleight;
Who free from Love lived in life's delight? * Where is he can
     boast of such liberty? 
     'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me:
     My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'
Deign Lord such suffering wight maintain * Then best Protector,
     protect him deign!
Establish him and his life assain * And defend him from all
     calamity:
     'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me:
     My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'"

And when Nur al-Din ended his say and ceased to sing his rhyming
lay, the Wazir's daughter said to herself, "By the virtue of the
Messiah and the Faith which is no liar, verily this Moslem is a
handsome youth! But doubtless he is a lover separated from his
mistress. Would Heaven I wot an the beloved of this fair one is
fair like unto him and if she pine for him as he for her! An she
be seemly as he is, it behoveth him to pour forth tears and make
moan of passion; but, an she be other than fair, his days are
wasted in vain regrets and he is denied the taste of
delights."--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to
say her permitted say. 

     When it was the Eight Hundred and Eighty-eighth Night,

She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the
Wazir's daughter said to herself, "An his beloved be fair as he,
it behoveth him to pour forth tears; and, if other than fair, his
heart is wasted in vain regrets!" Now Miriam the Girdle-girl, the
Minister's consort, had removed to the new palace the day before
and the Wazir's daughter knew that she was straitened of breast;
so she was minded to seek her and talk with her and tell her the
tidings of the young man and the rhymes and verses she had heard
him recite; but, before she could carry out her design the
Princess sent for her to cheer her with her converse. So she went
to her and found her heavy at heart and her tears hurrying down
her cheeks; and whilst she was weeping with sore weeping she
recited these couplets,

"My life is gone but love-longings remain * And my breast is
     straitened with pine and pain: 
And my heart for parting to melt is fain * Yet hoping that union
     will come again,
     And join us in one who now are twain.
Stint your blame to him who in heart's your thrall * With the
     wasted frame which his sorrows gall,
Nor with aim of arrow his heart appal * For parted lover is
     saddest of all,
     And Love's cup of bitters is sweet to drain!"

Quoth the Wazir's daughter to her, "What aileth thee, O Princess,
to be thus straitened in breast and sorrowful of thought?"
Whereupon Miriam recalled the greatness of the delights that were
past and recited these two couplets,

"I will bear in patience estrangement of friend * And on cheeks
     rail tears that like torrents wend:
Haply Allah will solace my sorrow, for He * Neath the ribs of
     unease maketh ease at end."

Said the Wazir's daughter, "O Princess, let not thy breast be
straitened, but come with me straightway to the lattice; for
there is with us in the stable[FN#556] a comely young man,
slender of shape and sweet of speech, and meseemeth he is a
parted lover." Miriam asked, "And by what sign knowest thou that
he is a parted lover?"; and she answered, "O Queen, I know it by
his improvising odes and verses all watches of the night and
tides of the day." Quoth the Princess in herself, "If what the
Wazir's daughter says be true, these are assuredly the traits of
the baffled, the wretched Ali Nur al-Din. Would I knew if indeed
he be the youth of whom she speaketh." At this thought,
love-longing and distraction of passion redoubled on her and she
rose at once and walking with the maiden to the lattice, looked
down upon the stables, where she saw her love and lord Nur al-Din
and fixing her eyes steadfastly upon him, knew him with the
bestest knowledge of love, albeit he was sick, of the greatness
of his affection for her and of the fire of passion, and the
anguish of separation and yearning and distraction. Sore upon him
was emaciation and he was improvising and saying, 

"My heart is a thrall; my tears ne'er abate * And their rains the
     railing of clouds amate;
'Twixt my weeping and watching and wanting love; * And whining
     and pining for dearest mate.
Ah my burning heat, my desire, my lowe! * For the plagues that
     torture my heart are eight;
And five upon five are in suite of them; * So stand and listen to
     all I state:
Mem'ry, madding thoughts, moaning languishment, * Stress of
     longing love, plight disconsolate; 
In travail, affliction and strangerhood, * And annoy and joy when
     on her I wait.
Fail me patience and stay for engrossing care * And sorrows my
     suffering soul regrate.
On my heart the possession of passion grows * O who ask of what
     fire in my heart's create,
Why my tears in vitals should kindle flame, * Burning heart with
     ardours insatiate,
Know, I'm drowned in Deluge[FN#557] of tears and my soul * From
     Laza-lowe fares to Hawiyah-goal."[FN#558] 

When the Princess Miriam beheld Nur al-Din and heard his loquence
and verse and speech, she made certain that it was indeed her
lord Nur al-Din; but she concealed her case from the Wazir's
daughter and said to her, "By the virtue of the Messiah and the
Faith which is no liar, I thought not thou knewest of my
sadness!" Then she arose forthright and withdrawing from the
window, returned to her own place, whilst the Wazir's daughter
went to her own occupations. The Princess awaited patiently
awhile, then returned to the window and sat there, gazing upon
her beloved Nur al-Din and delighting her eyes with his beauty
and inner and outer grace. And indeed, she saw that he was like
unto moon at full on fourteenth night; but he was ever sighing
with tears never drying, for that he recalled whatso he had been
abying. So he recited these couplets, 

"I hope for Union with my love which I may ne'er obtain * At all,
     but bitterness of life is all the gain I gain: 
My tears are likest to the main for ebb and flow of tide; * But
     when I meet the blamer-wight to staunch my tears I'm fain.
Woe to the wretch who garred us part by spelling of his
     spells;[FN#559] * Could I but hend his tongue in hand I'd
     cut his tongue in twain:
Yet will I never blame the days for whatso deed they did *
     Mingling with merest, purest gall the cup they made me
     drain!
To whom shall I address myself; and whom but you shall seek * A
     heart left hostage in your Court, by you a captive ta'en? 
Who shall avenge my wrongs on you,[FN#560] tyrant despotical *
     Whose tyranny but grows the more, the more I dare complain?
I made him regnant of my soul that he the reign assain * But me
     he wasted wasting too the soul I gave to reign.
Ho thou, the Fawn, whom I so lief erst gathered to my breast *
     Enow of severance tasted I to own its might and main,
Thou'rt he whose favours joined in one all beauties known to man,
     * Yet I thereon have wasted all my Patience' fair domain. 
I entertained him in my heart whereto he brought unrest * But I
     am satisfied that I such guest could entertain.
My tears for ever flow and flood, likest the surging sea * And
     would I wot the track to take that I thereto attain.
Yet sore I fear that I shall die in depths of my chagrin * And
     must despair for evermore to win the wish I'd win."

When Miriam heard the verses of Nur al-Din the loving-hearted,
the parted; they kindled in her vitals a fire of desire, and
while her eyes ran over with tears, she recited these two
couplets,

"I longed for him I love; but, when we met, * I was amazed nor
     tongue nor eyes I found.
I had got ready volumes of reproach; * But when we met, could
     syllable no sound."

When Nur al-Din heard the voice of Princess Miriam, he knew it
and wept bitter tears, saying, "By Allah, this is the chanting of
the Lady Miriam."--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased saying her permitted say.






End of Volume 8.





                    Arabian Nights, Volume 8
                           Footnotes




[FN#1]  Ironice; we are safe as long as we are defended by such a
brave.

[FN#2]  Blue, azure. This is hardly the place for a protest, but
I must not neglect the opportunity of cautioning my readers
against rendering Bahr al-Azrak ("Blue River") by "Blue Nile." No
Arab ever knew it by that name or thereby equalled it with the
White Nile. The term was a pure invention of Abyssinian Bruce who
was well aware of the unfact he was propagating, but his
inordinate vanity and self-esteem, contrasting so curiously with
many noble qualities, especially courage and self-reliance,
tempted him to this and many other a traveller's tale.

[FN#3]  This is orthodox Moslem doctrine and it does something
for the dignity of human nature which has been so unwisely
depreciated and degraded by Christianity. The contrast of Moslem
dignity and Christian abasement in the East is patent to every
unblind traveller.

[FN#4]  Here ends vol. iii. of the Mac. Edit.

[FN#5]  This famous tale is a sister prose-poem to the "Arabian
Odyssey" Sindbad the Seaman; only the Bassorite's travels are in
Jinn-land and Japan.  It has points of resemblance in
"fundamental outline" with the Persian Romance of the Fairy Hasan
B n£ and King Bahr m-i-G£r. See also the Kath  (s.s.) and the two
sons of the As£ra M y ; the Tartar "Sidhi K£r" (Tales of a
Vampire or Enchanted Corpse) translated by Mr. W. J. Thoms (the
Father of "Folk-lore" in 1846,) in "Lays and Legends of various
Nations"; the Persian Bah r-i-D nish (Prime of Lore). Miss
Stokes' "Indian Fairy Tales"; Miss Frere's "Old Deccan Days" and
Mrs. F. A. Steel's "Tale of the King and his Seven Sons," with
notes by Lieutenant (now Captain) R. C. Temple (Folk-lore of the
Panjab, Indian Antiquary of March, 1882).

[FN#6]  In the Mac.  Edit. (vol. iv. i.) the merchant has two
sons who became one a brazier ("dealer in copper-wares" says Lane
iii. 385) and the other a goldsmith.  The Bresl.  Edit. (v. 264)
mentions only one son, Hasan, the hero of the story which is
entitled, "Tale of Hasan al-Basri and the Isles of W k W k."

[FN#7]  Arab.  "Sh sh Abyaz:" this distinctive sign of the True
Believer was adopted by the Persian to conceal his being a
fire-worshipper, Magian or "Guebre." The latter word was
introduced from the French by Lord Byron and it is certainly far
superior to Moore's "Gheber."

[FN#8]  Persians being always a suspected folk.

[FN#9]  Arab.  "Al-B£dikah" afterwards used (Night dcclxxix) in
the sense of crucible or melting-pot, in modern parlance a
pipe-bowl; and also written "B£takah," an Arab distortion of the
Persian "B£tah."

[FN#10]  Arab.  "Sind n" or "Sindiy n" (Dozy).  "Sand n," anvil;
"Sind n," big, strong (Steingass).

[FN#11]  Arab.  "Kimiya," (see vol. i. 305) properly the
substance which transmutes metals, the "philosopher's stone"
which, by the by, is not a stone; and comes from {Greek letters},
a fluid, a wet drug, as opposed to Iksir (Al-) {Greek letters} a
dry drug.  Those who care to see how it is still studied will
consult my History of Sindh (chapt. vii) and my experience which
pointed only to the use made of it in base coinage. Hence in mod.
tongue Kimiy wi, an alchemist, means a coiner, a smasher. The
reader must not suppose that the transmutation of metals is a
dead study: I calculate that there are about one hundred workers
in London alone.

[FN#12]  Arab.  "Al-Kir," a bellows also = K£r, a furnace.  For
the full meaning of this sentence, see my "Book of the Sword," p.
119.

[FN#13]  Lit.  "bade him lean upon it with the shears" (Al-K z).

[FN#14]  There are many kinds of Kohls (Hindos.  Surm  and
Kajjal) used in medicine and magic.  See Herklots, p. 227.

[FN#15]  Arab. "Sabikah" = bar, lamina, from "Sabk" = melting,
smelting: the lump in the crucible would be hammered out into an
ingot in order to conceal the operation

[FN#16]  i.e. œ375.

[FN#17]  Such report has cost many a life: the suspicion was and
is still deadly as heresy in a "new Christian" under the
Inquisition.

[FN#18]  Here there is a double entendre: openly it means, "Few
men recognise as they should the bond of bread and salt:" the
other sense would be (and that accounts for the smile), "What the
deuce do I care for the bond?"

[FN#19]  Arab.  "Kabb t" in the Bresl. Edit. "Ka'ab n ": Lane
(iii. 519) reads "Ka' b plur. of Ka'ab a cup."

[FN#20]  A most palpable sneer.  But Hasan is purposely
represented as a "softy" till aroused and energized by the magic
of Love.

[FN#21]  Arab.  "Al-iksir" (see Night dcclxxix, supra p. 9): the
Greek word       which has returned from a trip to Arabia and
reappeared in Europe as "Elixir."

[FN#22]  "Aw k" plur. of "Ukiyah," the well-known "oke," or
"ocque," a weight varying from 1 to 2 lbs.  In Morocco it is
pronounced "Wukiyah," and = the Spanish ounce (p. 279 Rudimentos
del Arabe Vulgar, etc., by Fr. Jos‚ de Lorchundi, Madrid,
Rivadencyra, 1872).

[FN#23]  These lines have occurred in vol. iv. 267, where
references to other places are given.  I quote Lane by way of
variety.  In the text they are supposed to have been written by
the Persian, a hint that Hasan would never be seen again.

[FN#24]  i.e. a superfetation of iniquity.

[FN#25]  Arab.  "Kurb n" = offering, oblation to be brought to
the priest's house or to the altar of the tribal God Yahveh,
Jehovah (Levit. ii, 2-3 etc.). Amongst the Maronites Kurban is
the host (-wafer) and amongst the Turks 'Id al-Kurban
(sacrifice-feast) is the Greater Bayram, the time of Pilgrimage.

[FN#26]  N r = fire, being feminine, like the names of the other
"elements."

[FN#27]  The Egyptian Kurb j of hippopotamus-hide (Burkh. Nubia,
pp. 62,282) or elephant-hide (Turner ii. 365).  Hence the Fr.
Cravache (as Cravat is from Croat).

[FN#28]  In Mac. Edit. "Bahriyah": in Bresl. Edit. "Naw tiyah."
See vol. vi. 242, for       , navita, nauta.             

[FN#29]  In Bresl. Edit. (iv. 285) "Y  Khw jah," for which see
vol. vi. 46.

[FN#30]  Arab.  "Tabl" (vulg. baz) = a kettle-drum about half a
foot broad held in the left hand and beaten with a stick or
leathern thong.  Lane refers to his description (M.E. ii. chapt.
v.) of the Dervish's drum of tinned copper with parchment face,
and renders Zakhmah or Zukhmah (strap, stirrup-leather) by
"plectrum," which gives a wrong idea. The Bresl. Edit. ignores
the strap.

[FN#31]  The "Spartivento" of Italy, mostly a tall headland which
divides the clouds.  The most remarkable feature of the kind is
the Dalmatian Island, Pelagosa.

[FN#32]  The "Rocs" (Al-Arkh kh) in the Bresl. Edit. (iv. 290).
The Rakham = aquiline vulture.

[FN#33]  Lane here quotes a similar incident in the romance "Sayf
Z£ al-Yazan," so called from the hero, whose son, Misr, is sewn
up in a camel's hide by Bahr m, a treacherous Magian, and is
carried by the Rukhs to a mountain-top.

[FN#34]  These lines occurred in Night xxvi. vol. i. 275: I quote
Mr. Payne for variety.

[FN#35]  Thus a Moslem can not only circumcise and marry himself
but can also bury canonically himself.  The form of this prayer
is given by Lane M. E. chapt. xv.

[FN#36]  i.e. If I fail in my self-imposed duty, thou shalt
charge me therewith on the Judgment-day.

[FN#37]  Arab.  "Al-Alw n," plur. of laun (colour).  The latter
in Egyptian Arabic means a "dish of meat." See Burckhardt No.
279. I repeat that the great traveller's "Arabic Proverbs" wants
republishing for two reasons.  First he had not sufficient
command of English to translate with the necessary laconism and
assonance: secondly in his day British Philistinism was too
rampant to permit a literal translation. Consequently the book
falls short of what the Oriental student requires; and I have
prepared it for my friend Mr. Quaritch.

[FN#38]  i.e. Lofty, high-builded. See Night dcclxviii. vol. vii.
p. 347. In the Bresl. Edit. Al-Masid (as in Al-Kazwini): in the
Mac. Edit. Al-Mashid

[FN#39]  Arab. "Munkati" here = cut off from the rest of the
world. Applied to a man, and a popular term of abuse in Al-Hij z,
it means one cut off from the blessings of Allah and the benefits
of mankind; a pauvre sire. (Pilgrimage ii. 22.)

[FN#40]  Arab. "Baras au Juz m," the two common forms of leprosy.
See vol. iv. 51. Popular superstition in Syria holds that coition
during the menses breeds the Juz m, D a al-Kabir (Great Evil) or
D a al-Fil (Elephantine Evil), i.e. Elephantiasis and that the
days between the beginning of the flow (Sabil) to that of coition
shows the age when the progeny will be attacked; for instance if
it take place on the first day, the disease will appear in the
tenth year, on the fourth the fortieth and so on.  The only
diseases really dreaded by the Badawin are leprosy and small-pox. 
Coition during the menses is forbidden by all Eastern faiths
under the severest penalties. Al-Mas'£di relates how a man thus
begotten became a determined enemy of Ali; and the ancient Jews
attributed the magical powers of Joshua Nazarenus to this
accident of his birth, the popular idea being that sorcerers are
thus impurely engendered.

[FN#41]  By adoption - See vol. iii. 151. This sudden affection
(not love) suggests the "Come to my arms, my slight
acquaintance!" of the Anti-Jacobin.  But it is true to Eastern
nature; and nothing can be more charming than this fast
friendship between the Princess and Hasan.

[FN#42]  En tout bien et en tout honneur, be it understood.

[FN#43]  He had done nothing of the kind; but the feminine mind
is prone to exaggeration. Also Hasan had told them a fib, to
prejudice them against the Persian.

[FN#44]  These nervous movements have been reduced to a system in
the Turk. "Ihtil jn meh" = Book of palpitations, prognosticating
from the subsultus tendinum and other involuntary movements of
the body from head to foot; according to Ja'afar the Just, Daniel
the Prophet, Alexander the Great; the Sages of Persia and the
Wise Men of Greece. In England we attend chiefly to the eye and
ear.

[FN#45]  Revenge, amongst the Arabs, is a sacred duty; and, in
their state of civilization, society could not be kept together
without it. So the slaughter of a villain is held to be a
sacrifice to Allah, who amongst Christians claims for Himself the
monopoly of vengeance.

[FN#46]  Arab.  "Zindik." See vol. v. 230.

[FN#47]  Lane translates this "put for him the remaining food and
water;" but Ai-Akhar (Mac.  Edit.) evidently refers to the Najib
(dromedary).

[FN#48]  We can hardly see the heroism of the deed, but it must
be remembered that Bahram was a wicked sorcerer, whom it was
every good  Moslem's bounden duty to slay.  Compare the treatment
of witches in England two centuries ago.

[FN#49]  The mother in Arab tales is ma mŠre, now becoming
somewhat ridiculous in France on account of the over use of that
venerable personage.

[FN#50]  The forbidden closet occurs also in Sayf Z£ al-Yazan,
who enters it and finds the bird-girls.  Tr‚butien ii, 208 says,
"Il est assez remarquable qu'il existe en Allemagne une tradition
… peu prŠs semblable, et qui a fourni le sujet d'un des contes de
Musaeus, entitul‚, le voile enlev‚." Here Hasan is artfully left
alone in a large palace without other companions but his thoughts
and the reader is left to divine the train of ideas which drove
him to open the door.

[FN#51]  Arab.  "Buhayrah" (Bresl. Edit. "Bahrah"), the tank or
cistern in the Hosh (court-yard) of an Eastern house.  Here,
however, it is a rain-cistern on the flat roof of the palace (See
Night dcccviii).

[FN#52]  This description of the view is one of the most gorgeous
in The Nights.

[FN#53]  Here again are the "Swan-maidens" (See vol. v. 346) "one
of the primitive myths, the common heritage of the whole Aryan
(Iranian) race." In Persia Bahram-i-G£r when carried off by the
Div Sapid seizes the Peri's dove-coat: in Santh li folk-lore
Torica, the Goatherd, steals the garment doffed by one of the
daughters of the sun; and hence the twelve birds of Russian
Story.  To the same cycle belong the Seal-tales of the Faroe
Islands (Thorpe's Northern Mythology) and the wise women or
mermaids of Shetland (Hibbert).  Wayland the smith captures a
wife by seizing a mermaid's raiment and so did Sir Hag n by
annexing the wardrobe of a Danubian water-nymph.  Lettsom, the
translator, mixes up this swan-raiment with that of the Valkyries
or Choosers of the Slain. In real life stealing women's clothes
is an old trick and has often induced them, after having been
seen naked, to offer their persons spontaneously.  Of this I knew
two cases in India, where the theft is justified by divine
example.  The blue god Krishna, a barbarous and grotesque Hindu
Apollo, robbed the raiment of the pretty Gop lis (cowherdesses)
who were bathing in the Arjun River and carried them to the top
of a Kunduna tree; nor would he restore them till he had reviewed
the naked girls and taken one of them to wife.  See also Imr
al-Kays (of the Mu'allakah) with "Onaiza" at the port of
Daratjuljul (Clouston's Arabian Poetry, p.4). A critic has
complained of my tracing the origin of the Swan-maiden legend to
the physical resemblance between the bird and a high-bred girl
(vol. v. 346). I should have explained my theory which is
shortly, that we must seek a material basis for all so-called
supernaturalisms, and that anthropomorphism satisfactorily
explains the Swan-maiden, as it does the angel and the devil. 
There is much to say on the subject; but this is not the place
for long discussion.

[FN#54]  Arab.  "Nafs Amm rah," corresponding with our canting
term "The Flesh." Nafs al-N tikah is the intellectual soul or
function; Nafs al-Ghazabiyah = the animal function and Nafs al
Shahw niyah = the vegetative property.

[FN#55]  The lines occur in vol. ii. 331: I have quoted Mr.
Payne.  Here they are singularly out of place.

[FN#56]  Not the "green gown" of Anglo-India i.e. a white
ball-dress with blades of grass sticking to it in consequence of
a "fall backwards."

[FN#57]  These lines occur in vol. i. 219: I have borrowed from
Torrens (p. 219).

[FN#58]  The appearance of which ends the fast and begins the
Lesser Festival.  See vol. i. 84.

[FN#59]  See note, vol. i. 84, for notices of the large navel;
much appreciated by Easterns.

[FN#60]  Arab.  "Sh 'ir Al-Walah n" = the love-distraught poet;
Lane has "a distracted poet."  My learned friend Professor Aloys
Sprenger has consulted, upon the subject of Al-Walah n the
well-known Professor of Arabic at Halle, Dr. Thorbeck, who
remarks that the word (here as further on) must be an adjective,
mad, love-distraught, not a "lakab" or poetical cognomen.  He
generally finds it written Al-Sh 'ir al-Walah n (the
love-demented poet) not Al-Walah n al-Sh 'ir = Walah n the Poet. 
Note this burst of song after the sweet youth falls in love: it
explains the cause of verse-quotation in The Nights, poetry being
the natural language of love and battle.          

[FN#61]  "Them" as usual for "her."

[FN#62]  Here Lane proposes a transposition, for "Wa-huw  (and
he) fi'l-hubbi," to read "Fi 'l-hubbi wa huwa (wa-hwa);" but the
latter is given in the Mac. Edit.

[FN#63]  For the pun in "Sabr"=aloe or patience.  See vol. i.
138. In Herr Landberg (i. 93) we find a misunderstanding of the
couplet--

     "Aw' kibu s-sabri (K la ba'azuhum)
      Mahm£dah:  Kultu, 'khshi an takhirrini.'"

"The effects of patience" (or aloes) quoth one "are
praiseworthy!" Quoth I, "Much I fear lest it make me stool."
Mahm£dah is not only un laxatif, but a slang name for a
confection of aloes.

[FN#64]  Arab. "Ak£na fid -ka." Fid  = ransom, self-sacrifice and
Fid 'an = instead of.  The phrase, which everywhere occurs in The
Nights, means, "I would give my life to save thine "

[FN#65]  Thus accounting for his sickness, improbably enough but
in flattering way.  Like a good friend (feminine) she does not
hesitate a moment in prescribing a fib.

[FN#66]  i.e. the 25,000 Amazons who in the Bresl. Edit. (ii.
308) are all made to be the King's Ban t" = daughters or
prot‚g‚es. The Amazons of Dahome (see my "Mission") who may now
number 5,000 are all officially wives of the King and are called
by the lieges "our mothers."

[FN#67]  The tale-teller has made up his mind about the damsel;
although in this part of the story she is the chief and eldest
sister and subsequently she appears as the youngest daughter of
the supreme Jinn King.  The mystification is artfully explained
by the extraordinary likeness of the two sisters. (See Night
dcccxi.)

[FN#68]  This is a reminiscence of the old-fashioned "marriage by
capture," of which many traces survive, even among the civilised
who wholly ignore their origin.

[FN#69]  Meaning her companions and suite.

[FN#70]  Arab.  "'Ab ah" vulg.  "'Ab yah."  See vol. ii. 133.

[FN#71]  Feet in the East lack that development of sebaceous
glands which afflicts Europeans.

[FN#72]  i.e. cutting the animals' throats after Moslem law.

[FN#73]  In Night dcclxxviii. supra p.5, we find the orthodox
Moslem doctrine that "a single mortal is better in Allah's sight
than a thousand Jinns."  For, I repeat, Al-Islam systematically
exalts human nature which Christianity takes infinite trouble to
degrade and debase.  The results of its ignoble teaching are only
too evident in the East: the Christians of the so-called (and
miscalled) "Holy Land" are a disgrace to the faith and the
idiomatic Persian term for a Nazarene is "Tars " = funker,
coward.

[FN#74]  Arab.  "Sakaba K£rah ;" the forge in which children are
hammered out?

[FN#75]  Arab.  "M  al-Mal hat" = water (brilliancy) of beauty.

[FN#76]  The fourth of the Seven Heavens, the "Garden of
Eternity," made of yellow coral.

[FN#77]  How strange this must sound to the Young Woman of London
in the nineteenth century.

[FN#78]  "Forty days" is a quasi-religious period amongst Moslem
for praying, fasting and religious exercises: here it represents
our "honey-moon." See vol. v. p. 62.

[FN#79]  Y  layta, still popular.  Herr Carlo Landberg (Proverbes
et Dictons du Peuple Arabe, vol. i. of Syria, Leyden, E. J.
Brill, 1883) explains layta for rayta (=raayta) by permutation of
liquids and argues that the contraction is ancient (p. 42).  But
the Herr is no Arabist: "Layta" means "would to Heaven," or,
simply "I wish," "I pray" (for something possible or impossible);
whilst "La'alla" (perhaps, it may be) prays only for the
possible:  and both are simply particles governing the noun in
the oblique or accusative case.

[FN#80]  "His" for "her," i.e. herself, making somewhat of
confusion between her state and that of her son.

[FN#81]  i.e. his mother; the words are not in the Mac. Edit.

[FN#82]  Baghdad is called House of Peace, amongst other reasons,
from the Dijlah (Tigris) River and Valley "of Peace." The word
was variously written Baghd d, B ghd d, (our old Bughdaud and
Bagdat), Baghz z, Baghz n, Baghd n, Baghz m and Maghd d as Makkah
and Bakkah (Koran iii. 90).  Religious Moslems held B gh (idol)
and D d (gift) an ill-omened conjunction, and the Greeks changed
it to Eirenopolis. (See Ouseley's Oriental Collcctions, vol. i.
pp. 18-20.)

[FN#83]  This is a popular saying but hardly a "vulgar proverb."
(Lane iii. 522.) It reminds rather of Shakespear's:

     "So loving to my mother,
      That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
      Visit her face too roughly."

[FN#84]  i.e. God forbid that I should oppose thee!

[FN#85]  Here the writer again forgets apparently, that Shahrazad
is speaking: she may, however, use the plural for the singular
when speaking of herself.

[FN#86]  i.e. She would have pleaded ill-treatment and lawfully
demanded to be sold.

[FN#87]  The Hindus speak of "the only bond that woman knows--her
heart."

[FN#88]  i.e. a rarity, a present (especially in Persian).

[FN#89]  Arab.  "Al-bis t" wa'l-masnad lit. the carpet and the
cushion.

[FN#90]  For "B b al-bahr" and "B b al-Barr" see vol. iii. 281.

[FN#91]  She was the daughter of Ja'afar bin Mans£r; but, as will
be seen, The Nights again and again called her father Al-K sim.

[FN#92]  This is an error for the fifth which occurs in the
popular saying, "Is he the fifth of the sons of Al-Abb s!" i.e.
Harun al-Rashid.  Lane (note, in loco) thus accounts for the
frequent mention of the Caliph, the greatest of the Abbasides in
The Nights.  But this is a causa non causa.

[FN#93]  i.e. I find thy beauty all-sufficient.  So the proverb
"The son of the quarter (young neighbour) filleth not the eye,"
which prefers a stranger.

[FN#94]  They are mere doggerel, like most of the pieces de
circonstance.

[FN#95]  Afterwards called W k W k, and in the Bresl. Edit. W k
al-W k. See Lane's notes upon these Islands.  Arab Geographers
evidently speak of two Wak Waks.  Ibn al-Fakih and Al-Mas'£di
(Fr. Transl., vol. iii. 6-7) locate one of them in East Africa
beyond Zanzibar and Sofala. "Le territoire des Zendjes
(Zanzibar-Negroids) commence au canal (Al-Khalij) d‚riv‚ du haut
Nil (the Juln River?) et se prolonge jusqu'au pays de Sofalah et
des Wak-Wak." It is simply the peninsula of Guardafui (Jard
Hafun) occupied by the Gallas, pagans and Christians, before
these were ousted by the Moslem Somal; and the former perpetually
ejaculated "Wak" (God) as Moslems cry upon Allah.  This
identification explains a host of other myths such as the
Amazons, who as Marco Polo tells us held the "Female Island"
Socotra (Yule ii. 396).  The fruit which resembled a woman's head
(whence the puelloe Wakwakienses hanging by the hair from trees),
and which when ripe called out "Wak Wak" and "Allah al-Khall k"
(the Creator) refers to the Calabash-tree (Adausonia digitata),
that grotesque growth, a vegetable elephant, whose gourds,
something larger than a man's head, hang by a slender filament. 
Similarly the "cocoa" got its name, in Port. = Goblin, from the
fancied face at one end. The other Wak Wak has been identified in
turns with the Seychelles, Madagascar, Malacca, Sunda or Java
(this by LanglŠs), China and Japan.  The learned Prof. de Goeje
(Arabishe Berichten over Japan, Amsterdam, Muller, 1880) informs
us that in Canton the name of Japan is Wo-Kwok, possibly a
corruption of Koku-tan, the ebony-tree (Diospyros ebenum) which
Ibn Khor-d bah and others find together with gold in an island
4,500 parasangs from Suez and East of China.  And we must
remember that Basrah was the chief starting-place for the
Celestial Empire during the rule of the Tang dynasty (seventh and
ninth centuries). Colonel J. W. Watson of Bombay suggests New
Guinea or the adjacent islands where the Bird of Paradise is said
to cry "Wak Wak!" Mr. W. F. Kirby in the Preface (p. ix.) to his
neat little book "The New Arabian Nights," says: "The Islands of
Wak-Wak, seven years' journey from Bagdad, in the story of Hasan,
have receded to a distance of a hundred and fifty years' journey
in that of Majin (of Khorasan).  There is no doubt(?) that the
Cora Islands, near New Guinea, are intended; for the wonderful
fruits which grow there are Birds of Paradise, which settle in
flocks on the trees at sunset and sunrise, uttering this very
cry." Thus, like Ophir, Wak Wak has wandered all over the world
and has been found even in Peru by the Turkish work T rikh
al-Hind al-Gharbi = History of the West Indies (Orient. Coll. iii
189).

[FN#96]  I accept the emendation of Lane's Shaykh, "Nasim "
(Zephyr) for "Nadim " (cup-companion).

[FN#97]  "Jannat al-N 'im" = Garden of Delights is No. V Heaven,
made of white diamond.

[FN#98]  This appears to her very prettily put.

[FN#99]  This is the "House of Sadness" of our old chivalrous
Romances. See chapt. vi. of "Palmerin of England," by Francisco
de Moraes (ob. 1572), translated by old Anthony Munday (dateless,
1590?) and "corrected" (read spoiled) by Robert Southey, London,
Longmans, 1807.

[FN#100]  The lines have occurred in Night clix. (vol. iii. 183),
I quote Mr. Payne who, like Lane, prefers "in my bosom" to
"beneath my ribs."

[FN#101]  In this tale the Bresl. Edit. more than once adds "And
let us and you send a blessing to the Lord of Lords" (or to
"Mohammed," or to the "Prophet"); and in vol. v. p. 52 has a long
prayer.  This is an act of contrition in the tale-teller for
romancing against the expressed warning of the Founder of
Al-Islam.

[FN#102]  From Bresl. Edit. (vi. 29): the four in the Mac. Edit.
are too irrelevant.

[FN#103]  Arab.  "Ghay£r"--jealous, an admirable epithet which
Lane dilutes to "changeable"--making a truism of a metaphor.

[FN#104]  These lines have occurred before.  I quote Mr. Payne.

[FN#105]  i.e. One fated to live ten years.

[FN#106]  This poetical way of saying "fourteen" suggests Camoens
(The Lusiads) Canto v. 2.

[FN#107]  Arab.  "Surrah," lit. = a purse: a few lines lower down
it is called "'Ulbah" = a box which, of course, may have
contained the bag.

[FN#108]  The month which begins the Moslem year.

[FN#109]  As an Arab often does when deep in thought.  Lane
appositely quotes John viii. 6. "Jonas stooped down, and with his
finger wrote on the ground." Mr. Payne translates, "He fell
a-drumming on the earth with his fingers," but this does not
complete the sense.

[FN#110]  i.e."And the peace of Allah be upon thee! that will end
thy story."  The Arab formula, "Wa al-Sal m" (pron.  Wassal m) is
used in a variety of senses.

[FN#111]  Like Camoens, one of the model lovers, he calls upon
Love to torment him still more--ad majorern Dei (amoris) gloriam.

[FN#112]  Pron.  Aboor-Ruwaysh.  "The Father of the little
Feather": he is afterwards called "Son of the daughter of the
accursed Iblis"; yet, as Lane says, "he appears to be a virtuous
person."

[FN#113]  Arab.  "Kantara al-lij m fi Karb£s (bow) sarjih."

[FN#114]  I do not translate "beckoned" because the word would
give a wrong idea.  Our beckoning with the finger moved towards
the beckoner makes the so-beckoned Eastern depart in all haste.
To call him you must wave the hand from you.

[FN#115]  The Arabs knew what large libraries were; and a learned
man could not travel without camel-loads of dictionaries.

[FN#116]  Arab.  "Adim;" now called Bulgh r, our Moroccan
leather.

[FN#117]  Arab.  "Zin d," which Lane renders by "instruments for
striking fire," and Mr. Payne, after the fashion of the
translators of Al-Hariri, "flint and steel."

[FN#118]  A congener of Hasan and Husayn, little used except in
Syria where it is a favourite name for Christians.  The Muhit of
Butrus Al-Bost ni (s.v.) tells us that it also means a bird
called Ab£ Hasan and supplies various Egyptian synonyms.  In Mod.
Arab. Grammar the form Fa''£l is a diminutive as Hamm£d for
Ahmad, 'Amm£r for 'Amr£. So the fem. form, Fa''£lah, e.g.
Khadd£gah = little Khadijah and Naff£sah=little Nafisah; Ar'£rah
= little clitoris - whereas in Heb. it is an incrementative e.g.
dabb£lah a large dablah (cake or lump of dried figs, etc.).

[FN#119]  In the Mac. Edit. "Soldiers of Al-Daylam" i.e. warlike
as the Daylamites or Medes.  See vol. ii. 94.

[FN#120]  Bilkis, it will be remembered, is the Arab. name of the
Queen of Sheba who visited Solomon.  In Abyssinia she is termed
Kebra z  negest or z  makad , the latter (according to Ferdinand
Werne's "African Wanderings," Longmans, 1852) being synonymous
with Ityopia or Habash (Ethiopia or Abyssinia).

[FN#121]  Arab.  "Dakkah," which Lane translates by "settee."

[FN#122]  Arab. "Ambar al-Kh m" the latter word (raw) being pure
Persian.

[FN#123]  The author neglects to mention the ugliest part of
old-womanhood in the East, long empty breasts like
tobacco-pouches. In youth the bosom is beautifully high, arched
and rounded, firm as stone to the touch, with the nipples erect
and pointing outwards.  But after the girl-mother's first child
(in Europe le premier embellit) all changes.  Nature and bodily
power have been overtasked; then comes the long suckling at the
mother's expense: the extension of the skin and the enlargement
of its vessels are too sudden and rapid for the diminished
ability of contraction and the bad food aids in the continual
consumption of vitality.  Hence, among Eastern women age and
ugliness are synonymous.  It is only in the highest civilisation
that we find the handsome old woman.

[FN#124]  The name has occurred in the Knightly tale of King Omar
and his sons, Vol. ii. 269.  She is here called Mother of
Calamities,but in p. 123, Vol. iv. of the Mac. Edit. she becomes
"Lady (Z t) al-Daw hi." It will be remembered that the title
means calamitous to the foe.

[FN#125]  By this address she assured him that she had no design
upon his chastity. In Moslem lands it is always advisable to
accost a strange woman, no matter how young, with, "Y  Ummi!" = O
my mother. This is pledging one's word, as it were, not to make
love to her.

[FN#126]  Apparently the Wakites numbered their Islands as the
Anglo-Americans do their streets.  For this they have been
charged with "want of imagination"; but the custom is strictly
classical. See at Pompeii "Reg (io) I; Ins (ula) 1, Via Prima,
Secunda," etc.

[FN#127]  These are the Puell‘ Wakwakienses of whom Ibn Al-Wardi
relates after an ocular witness, "Here too is a tree which bears
fruits like women who have fair faces and are hung by their hair.
They come forth from integuments like large leathern bags
(calabash-gourds?) and when they sense air and sun they cry 'Wak! 
Wak!' (God!  God!) till their hair is cut, and when it is cut
they die; and the islanders understand this cry wherefrom they
augure ill." The Aj ib al-Hind (chapt. xv.) places in Wak-land
the Samandal, a bird which enters the fire without being burnt
evidently the Egyptian "Pi-Benni," which the Greeks metamorphised
to "Phoenix." It also mentions a hare-like animal, now male then
female, and the Somal behind Cape Guardafui tell the same tale of
their Cynhy‘nas.

[FN#128]  i.e. I will keep thee as though thou wert the apple of
my eye.

[FN#129]  A mere exaggeration of the "Gull-fairs" noted by
travellers in sundry islands as Ascension and the rock off
Brazilian Santos.

[FN#130]  Arab.  "K mil wa Basit wa W fir" = the names of three
popular metres, for which see the Terminal Essay.

[FN#131]  Arab.  "Man shif" = drying towels, Plur. of Minshafah,
and the popular term which Dr. Jonathan Swift corrupted to
"Munnassaf." Lane (Nights, Introduct. p. ix.).

[FN#132]  Arab.  "Shafaif" opposed to "Shafah" the mouth-lips.

[FN#133]  Fountains of Paradise. This description is a fair
instance of how the Saj'a (prose-rhyme) dislocates the order; an
Arab begins with hair, forehead, eyebrows and lashes and when he
reaches the nose, he slips down to the toes for the sake of the
assonance.  If the latter be neglected the whole list of charms
must be otherwise ordered; and the student will compare Mr.
Payne's version of this passage with mine.

[FN#134]  A fair specimen of the Arab logogriph derived from the
Abjad Alphabet which contains only the Hebrew and Syriac letters
not the six Arabic.  Thus 4 X 5=20 which represents the Kaf (K)
and 6 X 10=60, or Sin (S).  The whole word is thus "Kos", the
Greek {Greek letters} or {Greek letters}, and the lowest word, in
Persian as in Arabic, for the female pudenda, extensively used in
vulgar abuse.  In my youth we had at the University something of
the kind,

     To five and five and fifty-five
     The first of letters add
     To make a thing to please a King
     And drive a wise man mad.

Answer VVLVA.  Very interesting to the anthropological student is
this excursus of Hasan, who after all manner of hardships and
horrors and risking his life to recover his wife and children,
breaks out into song on the subject of her privities.  And it can
hardly be tale-teller's gag as both verse and prose show
considerable art in composition. (See p. 348.)

Supplementary Note To Hasan of Bassorah.

Note(p.93)--There is something wondrous naive in a lover who,
when asked by his mistress to sing a song in her honour, breaks
out into versical praises of her parts.  But even the classical
Arab authors did not disdain such themes.  See in Al-Hariri (Ass.
of Mayyafarikin) where Abu Zayd laments the impotency of old age
in form of a Rasy or funeral oration (Preston p. 484, and Chenery
p. 221).  It completely deceived Sir William Jones, who inserted
it into the chapter "De Poesi Funebri," p. 527 (Poeseos Asiaticae
Commentarii), gravely noting, "Haec Elegia non admodum dissimilis
esse videtur pulcherrimi illius carminis de Sauli et Jonathani
obitu; at que adeo versus iste 'ubi provocant adversarios nunquam
rediit a pugnae contentione sine spiculo sanguine imbuto, 'ex
Hebraeoreddi videtur,

          A sanguine occisorum, a fortium virorum adipe,
          Arcus Jonathani non rediit irritus."

I need hardly say with Captain Lockett (226) that this "Sabb
warrior," this Arabian Achilles, is the celebrated Bonus Deus or
Hellespontiacus of the Ancients.  The oration runs thus:--

          O folk I have a wondrous tale, so rare
          Much shall it profit hearers wise and ware!
          I saw in salad-years a potent Brave
          And sharp of edge and point his warrior glaive;
          Who entered joust and list with hardiment
          Fearless of risk, of victory confident,
          His vigorous onset straitest places oped
          And easy passage through all narrows groped:
          He ne'er encountered foe in single fight
          But came from tilt with spear in blood stained bright;
          Nor stormed a fortress howso strong and stark--
          With fenced gates defended deep and dark--
          When shown his flag without th' auspicious cry
          "Aidance from Allah and fair victory nigh!" 
          Thus wise full many a night his part he played
          In strength and youthtide's stately garb arrayed,
          Dealing to fair young girl delicious joy
          And no less welcome to the blooming boy.
          But Time ne'er ceased to stint his wondrous strength
          (Steadfast and upright as the gallow's length)
          Until the Nights o'erthrew him by their might
          And friends contemned him for a feckless wight;
          Nor was a wizard but who wasted skill
          Over his case, nor leach could heal his ill.
          Then he abandoned arms abandoned him
          Who gave and took salutes so fierce and grim;
          And now lies prostrate drooping haughty crest;
          For who lives longest him most ills molest.
          Then see him, here he lies on bier for bet;--
          Who will a shroud bestow on stranger dead?

A fair measure of the difference between Eastern and Western
manners is afforded by such a theme being treated by their
gravest writers and the verses being read and heard by the
gravest and most worshipful men, whilst amongst us Preston and
Chenery do not dare even to translate them.  The latter, indeed,
had all that immodest modesty for which English professional
society is notable in this xixth century.  He spoiled by
needlessly excluding from a scientific publication (Mem. R.A.S.)
all of my Proverbia Communia Syriaca (see Unexplored Sryia, i.
364) and every item which had a shade of double entendre.  But
Nemesis frequently found him out: during his short and obscure
rule in Printing House Square, The Thunderer was distinguished by
two of the foulest indecencies that ever appeared in an English
paper.

   The well-known Koranic verse, whereby Allah is introduced into
an indecent tale and "Holy Writ" is punned upon.  I have noticed
(iii. 206) that victory Fat'h lit.=opening everything (as e.g. a
maidenhead).

[FN#135]  Egyptian and Syrian vulgar term for Maw liyah or
Maw liyah, a short poem on subjects either classical or vulgar. 
It generally consists of five lines all rhyming except the
penultimate.  The metre is a species of the Basit which, however,
admits of considerable poetical license; this being according to
Lane the usual "Weight,"

     --U-/-U-/--U-/--.

The scheme is distinctly anapaestic and Mr. Lyall (Translations
of Ancient Arabic Poetry) compares with a cognate metre, the
Tawil, certain lines in Abt Vogler, e.g.

  "Ye know why the forms are fair, ye hear how the tale is told."

[FN#136]  i.e. repeat the chapter of the Koran termed The
Opening, and beginning with these words, "Have we not opened thy
breast for thee and eased thee of thy burden which galled thy
back? *** Verily with the difficulty cometh ease!"--Koran xciv.
vol. 1, 5.

[FN#137]  Lane renders Nur al-Hud… (Light of Salvation) by Light
of Day which would be Nur al-Had….

[FN#138]  In the Bresl. Edit.  "Y  Sal m"=O safety!--a vulgar
ejaculation.

[FN#139]  A favourite idiom meaning from the mischief which may
(or will) come from the Queen.

[FN#140]  He is not strong-minded but his feminine persistency of
purpose, likest to that of a sitting hen, is confirmed by the
"Consolations of religion."  The character is delicately drawn.

[FN#141]  In token that she intended to act like a man.

[FN#142]  This is not rare even in real life: Moslem women often
hide and change their names for superstitious reasons, from the
husband and his family.

[FN#143]  Arab.  "Sabab" which also means cause.  Vol. ii. 14.
There is the same metaphorical use of "Habl"= cord and cause.

[FN#144]  Arab. "Him…," a word often occurring in Arab poetry,
domain, a pasture or watered land forcibly kept as far as a dog's
bark would sound by some masterful chief like "King Kulayb." (See
vol. ii. 77.) This tenure was forbidden by Mohammed except for
Allah and the Apostle (i.e. himself).  Lane translates it
"asylum."

[FN#145]  She was a maid and had long been of marriageable age.

[FN#146]  The young man had evidently "kissed the Blarney stone";
but the flattery is the more telling as he speaks from the heart.
