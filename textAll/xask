Shushah or top-knot of hair, see vol. i. 308. It is differently
worn in the several regions of the Moslem world: the Maroccans of
the Rif country grow it not on the poll but on one side of the
head. As a rule, however, it is confined to boys, and is shaved
off at puberty.

[FN#366]  Suspecting her to be a witch because she was old and
poor. The same was the case in Europe when these unfortunates
were burned during the early part of the last century and even
now the country-folk are often ready to beat or drown them. The
abominable witchcraft acts, which arose from bibliolatry and
belief in obsolete superstitions, can claim as many victims in
"Protestant" countries, England and the Anglo-American States as
the Jesuitical Inquisition.

[FN#367]  It is not easy to make sense of this passage especially
when the Wazir is spoken of.

[FN#368]  This is a rechauffe of the Sandal-Wood Merchant and the
Sharpers. Vol. vi. 202.

[FN#369]  I have followed Mr. Payne's adaptation of the text as
he makes sense, whilst the Arabic does not. I suppose that the
holes are disposed crosswise.

[FN#370]  i.e. Thy skill is so great that thou wilt undermine my
authority with the king.

[FN#371]  This famous tale is first found in a small collection
of Latin fables (Adolphi Fabulae apud Leyser Hist. Poet. Medii
AEvi, p. 200-8), beginning

     Caecus erat quidam, cui pulcra virago, etc.

The date is 1315, and Caxton printed it in English in 1483; hence
it was adopted by Boccaccio, Day vii., Novella 9; whence
Chaucer's "Marchaundes Tale": this, by-the-by, was translated by
Pope in his sixteenth or seventeenth year, and christened
"January and May." The same story is inserted in La Fontaine
(Contes, lib. ii., No. 8), "La Gageure des trois Commeres," with
the normal poirier; and lastly it appears in Wieland's "Oberon,"
canto vi.; where the Fairy King restores the old husband's sight,
and Titania makes the lover on the pear-tree invisible. Mr.
Clouston refers me also to the Bahar-i-Danish, or Prime of
Knowledge (Scott's translation, vol. ii., pp. 64-68); "How the
Brahman learned the Tirrea Bede"; to the Turkish "Kirk Wazir"
(Forty Wazirs) of the Shaykh-Zadeh (xxivth Wazir's story); to the
"Comoedia Lydiae," and to Barbazan's "Fabliaux et Contes" t. iii.
p. 451, "La Saineresse," the cupping-woman.

[FN#372]  In the European versions it is always a pear-tree.

[FN#373]  This supernatural agency, ever at hand and ever
credible to Easterns, makes this the most satisfactory version of
the world-wide tale.

[FN#374]  i.e. till next harvest time.

[FN#375]  The "'Ashshar," or Tither, is most unpopular in the
Nile-valley as in Wales; and he generally merits his ill-repute.
Tales concerning the villainy of these extortioners abound in
Egypt and Syria. The first step in improvement will be so to
regulate the tithes that the peasants may not be at the mercy of
these "publicans and sinners" who, however, can plead that they
have paid highly for appointment to office and must recoup
themselves.

[FN#376]  Arab. "'Ammir"=cause to flourish.

[FN#377]  Arab. "Afkah," a better Fakih or theologian; all Moslem
law being based upon the Koran, the Sayings (Hadis) and Doings
(Sunnat) of the Prophet; and, lastly, the Rasm or immemorial
custom of the country provided that it be not opposed to the
other three.

[FN#378]  If the number represent the days in the Moslem year it
should be 354=6 months of 29 days and the rest of 30).

[FN#379]  The affirmative particle "kad" preceding a verb in the
past gives it a present and at times a future signification.

[FN#380]  A danik, the Persian "Dang," is one-sixth of a dirham,
i.e. about one penny. See vol. ii. 204.

[FN#381]  It would mightily tickle an Eastern audience to hear of
a Tither being unable to do any possible amount of villainy.

[FN#382]  i.e. The oath of triple divorce which is, I have said,
irrevocable, and the divorcee may not be taken again by her
husband till her marriage with another man (the Mustahill of The
Nights) has been consummated. See vol. iv., 48.

[FN#383]  i.e. thousandfold cuckold.

[FN#384]  Arab. "Wadi'ah"=the blows which the Robber had given
him.

[FN#385]  Arab. "Sindiyan" (from the Persian) gen. used for the
holm-oak, the Quercus pseudococcifera, vulgarly termed ilex, or
native oak, and forming an extensive scrub in Syria, For this and
other varieties of Quercus, as the Mallul and the Ballut, see
Unexplored Syria, i. 68.

[FN#386]  Hibernice

[FN#387]  Lit. "In the way of moderation"=at least, at the most
moderate reckoning.

[FN#388]  Arab. "Rasmal," the vulg. Syrian and Egyptian form of
Raas al-mal=stockin-trade.

[FN#389]  Usually a ring or something from his person to show
that all was fair play; here however, it was a watchword.

[FN#390]  Arab. "Ya Madyubah," prob. a clerical error for
"Madyunah," alluding to her many debts which he had paid. Here,
however, I suspect the truly Egyptian term "Ya Manyukah!"=O thou
berogered; a delicate term of depreciation which may be heard a
dozen times a day in the streets of Cairo. It has also a
masculine form, "Ya Manyuk!"

[FN#391]  About=100 lb. Mr. Sayce (Comparative Philol. p. 210)
owns that Mn is old Egyptian but makes it a loan from the
"Semites," like Sus (horse), Sar (prince), Sepet (lip) and
Murcabutha (chariot), and goes to its origin in the Acratan
column, because "it is not found before the times when the
Egyptians borrowed freely from Palestine." But surely it is
premature to draw such conclusion when we have so much still to
learn concerning the dates of words in Egyptian.

[FN#392]  Arab. Jami'. This anachronism, like many of the same
kind, is only apparent. The faith preached by Sayyidna Isa was
the Islam of his day and dispensation, and it abrogated all other
faiths till itself abrogated by the mission of Mahommed. It is
therefore logical to apply to it terms which we should hold to be
purely Moslem. On the other hand it is not logical to paint the
drop-curtain of the Ober-Ammergau "Miracle-play" with the Mosque
of Omar and the minarets of Al-Islam. I humbly represented this
fact to the mechanicals of the village whose performance brings
them in so large a sum every decade; but Snug, Snout and Bottom
turned up the nose of contempt and looked upon me as a mere
"shallow sceptic."

[FN#393]  Arab. "Talamizah," plur. of Tilmiz, a disciple, a young
attendant. The word is Syriac <Arabic letters> and there is a
Heb. root <Hebrew letters> but no Arabic. In the Durrat
al-Ghawwas, however, Tilmiz, Bilkis, and similar words are Arabic
in the form of Fa'lil and Fi'lil

[FN#394]  Ruh Allah, lit.=breath of Allah, attending to the
miraculous conception according to the Moslems. See vol. v. 238.

[FN#395]  Readers will kindly pronounce this word "Sahra" not
Sahara.

[FN#396]  Mr. Clouston refers for analogies to this tale to his
"Oriental Sources of some of Chaucer's Tales" (Notes and Queries,
1885-86), and he finds the original of The Pardoner's Tale in one
of the Jatakas or Buddhist Birth-stories entitled Vedabbha
Jataka. The story is spread over all Europe; in the Cento Novelle
Antiche; Morlini; Hans Sachs, etc. And there are many Eastern
versions, e.g. a Persian by Farid al-Din "'Attar" who died at a
great age in A.D. 1278; an Arabic version in The Orientalist
(Kandy, 1884); a Tibetan in Rollston's Tibetan Tales; a
Cashmirian in Knowles' Dict. of Kashmiri Proverbs, etc., etc.,
etc.

[FN#397]  Arab. "'Awan" lit.=aids, helpers; the "Aun of the Jinn"
has often occurred.

[FN#398]  i.e. the peasant.

[FN#399]  i.e. those serving on the usual feudal tenure; and
bound to suit and service for their fiefs.

[FN#400]  i.e. the yearly value of his fief.

[FN#401]  i.e. men who paid taxes.

[FN#402]  Arab. "Rasatik" plur. of Rustak. See vol. vi. 289.

[FN#403]  This adventure is a rechauffe of Amjad's adventure
(vol. iii. 333) without, however, its tragic catastrophe.

[FN#404]  The text is so concise as to be enigmatical. The house
was finely furnished for a feast, as it belonged to the Man who
was lavish, etc.

[FN#405]  Arab. "Khubz Samiz;" the latter is the Arabisation of
the Pers. Samid, fine white bread, simnel, Germ. semmel.

[FN#406]  The text has "Bakulat"=pot-herbs; but it is probably a
clerical error for "Baklawat." See vol. ii. 311.

[FN#407]  Egyptian-like he at once calls upon Allah to witness a
lie and his excuse would be that the lie was well-intentioned.

[FN#408]  i.e. The private bagnio which in old days every grand
house possessed.

[FN#409]  This is a fancy title, but it suits the tale better
than that in the text (xi. 183) "The Richard who lost his wealth
and his wits." Mr. Clouston refers to similar stories in
Sacchetti and other early Italian novelists.

[FN#410]  Arab. "Al-Muwaswis": for "Wiswas" see vol. i. 106. This
class of men in stories takes the place of our "cunning idiot,"
and is often confounded with the Saudawi, the melancholist
proper.

[FN#411]  Arab. "Hamhama," an onomapoeic, like our hum, hem, and
haw.

[FN#412]  Arab. "Barniyah," a vessel either of glass or pottery
like that in which the manna was collected (Exod. xvi. 33).

[FN#413]  A hasty man, as Ghazban=an angry man.

[FN#414]  The Bresl. Edit. misprint. "Khablas" in more places
than one, now with a Sin, then with a Sad. Khalbas suggests
"Khalbus," a buffoon, for which see vol. ii. 143. In Egypt,
however, the latter generally ends in a Sad (see Lane's
"Khalboos," M. E. chap. xxvii).

[FN#415]  This story is a rechauffe of the Jewish Kazi and his
pious wife; see vol. v. 256.

[FN#416]  The Arab form of "Nayshapur"=reeds of (King) Shapur:
see vol. ix. 230.

[FN#417]  Arab. "Ala Tarik al-Satr wa al-Salamah," meaning that
each other's wives did not veil before their brothers-in-law as
is usually done. It may also mean that they were under Allah's
protection and in best of condition.

[FN#418]  i.e. he dared not rape her.

[FN#419]  i.e. her "yes" meant "yes" and her "no" meant "no."

[FN#420]  "Ignorance" (Jahl) may, here and elsewhere, mean
wickedness, forwardness, folly, vicious folly or uncalled-for
wrath. Here Arabic teaches a good lesson, for ignorance,
intemperance and egoism are, I repeat, the roots of all evil.

[FN#421]  So Mohammed said of a child born in adultery "The babe
to the blanket (i.e. let it be nursed and reared) and the
adultress to the stone."

[FN#422]  Arab. "Wa ha," etc., an interjection corresponding with
the Syriac "ho" lo! (i.e., look) behold! etc.

[FN#423]  This paragraph is supplied by Mr. Payne: something of
the kind has evidently fallen out of the Arab text.

[FN#424]  i.e. in the presence of witnesses, legally.

[FN#425]  Lit. a myriad, ten thousand dirhams. See vol. iv. 281.

[FN#426]  The fire was intended to defend the mother and babe
from Jinns, bad spirits, the evil eye, etc. Romans lit candles in
the room of the puerpara; hence the goddess Candelifera, and the
term Candelaria applied to the B.V. In Brand's Popular
Antiquities (ii. 144) we find, "Gregory mentions an ordinary
superstition of the old wives who dare not trust a child in a
cradle by itself alone without a candle;" this was for fear of
the "night-hag" (Milton, P. L., ii. 662). The same idea prevailed
in Scotland and in Germany: see the learned Liebrecht (who
translated the Pentamerone) "Zur Folkskunde," p. 31. In Sweden if
the candle go out, the child may be carried off by the Trolls
(Weckenstedt, Wendische Sagen, p. 446). The custom has been
traced to the Malay peninsula, whither it was probably imported
by the Hindus or the Moslems, and amongst the Tajiks in Bokhara.
For the Hindu practice, see Katha S. S. 305, and Prof. Tawney's
learned note analysed above.

[FN#427]  Arab. "Kahinah," fem. of Kahin (Cohen): see Kahanah,
vol. i. 28.

[FN#428]  i.e. for a long time, as has been before explained.

[FN#429]  i.e. at his service. Arabia was well provided with
Hetairae and public women long before the days of Al-Islam.

[FN#430]  Arab. "Athar"=sign, mark, trail.

[FN#431]  i.e. Persia. See vol. v. 26.

[FN#432]  Arab. "'Akakir" plur. of 'Akkar prop.=aromatic roots;
but applied to vulgar drugs or simples, as in the Tale of the
Sage Duban, i. 46.

[FN#433]  Arab. "Si'at rizki-h" i.e., the ease with which he
earned his copious livelihood.

[FN#434]  i.e. the ten thousand dirhams of the bond, beside the
unpaid and contingent portion of her "Mahr" or
marriage-settlement.

[FN#435]  Arab. "Al-Hazur" from Hazr=loquacity, frivolous
garrulity. Every craft in the East has a jargon of its own and
the goldsmith (Zargar) is famed for speaking a language made
unintelligible by the constant insertion of a letter or letters
not belonging to the word. It is as if we rapidly pronounced How
d'ye do=Howth doth yeth doth?

[FN#436]  Arab. "Asma al-Adwiyah," such as are contained in
volumes like the "Alfaz al-Adwi-yah" (Nomenclature of Drugs).

[FN#437]  I am compelled to insert a line in order to make sense.

[FN#438]  "Galen," who is considered by Moslems as a kind of
pre-Islamitic Saint; and whom Rabelais (iii. c. 7) calls Le
gentil Falot Galen, is explained by Eustathius as the Serene
{Greek} from {Greek}=rideo.

[FN#439]  Arab. "Sahah" the clear space before the house as
opposed to the "Bathah" (Span. Patio) the inner court.

[FN#440]  A naive description of the naive style of reclame
adopted by the Eastern Bob Sawyer.

[FN#441]  Which they habitually do, by the by, with an immense
amount of unpleasant detail. See Pilgrimage i. 18.

[FN#442]  The old French name for the phial or bottle in which
the patient's water is sent.

[FN#443]  A descendant from Mohammed, strictly through his
grandson Husayn. See vol. iv. 170.

[FN#444]  Arab. "Al-Futuh" lit. the victories; a euphemistic term
for what is submitted to the "musculus guineaorum."

[FN#445]  Arab. "Firasah" lit. judging the points of a mare
(faras). Of physiognomy, or rather judging by externals, curious
tales are told by the Arabs. In Al-Mas'udi's (chapt. lvi.) is the
original of the camel blind of one eye, etc., which the genius of
Voltaire has made famous throughout Europe.

[FN#446]  I here quote Mr. Payne's note. "Sic in the text; but
the passage is apparently corrupt. It is not plain why a rosy
complexion, blue eyes and tallness should be peculiar to women in
love. Arab women being commonly short, swarthy and blackeyed, the
attributes mentioned appear rather to denote the foreign origin
of the woman; and it is probable, therefore, that this passage
has by a copyist's error, been mixed up with that which relates
to the signs by which the mock physician recognised her
strangerhood, the clause specifying the symptoms of her love-lorn
condition having been crowded out in the process, an accident of
no infrequent occurrence in the transcription of Oriental works."

[FN#447]  Most men would have suspected that it was her lover.

[FN#448]  The sumptuary laws, compelling for instance the Jews to
wear yellow turbans, and the Christians to carry girdles date
from the Capture of Jerusalem in A.D. 636 by Caliph Omar. See
vol. i. 77; and Terminal Essay § 11.

[FN#449]  i.e. Our Sunday: the Jewish week ending with the
Sabbath (Saturday). I have already noted this term for Saturn's
day, established as a God's rest by Commandment No. iv. How it
lost its honours amongst Christians none can say: the text in
Col. ii. 16, 17, is insufficient to abolish an order given with
such pomp and circumstance to, and obeyed, so strictly and
universally by, the Hebrews, including the Founder of
Christianity. The general idea is that the Jewish Sabbath was
done away with by the Christian dispensation (although Jesus kept
it with the usual scrupulous care), and that sundry of the
Councils at Colossae and Laodicea anathematised those who observed
the Saturday after Israelitish fashion. With the day its object
changed; instead of "keeping it holy," as all pious Jews still
do, the early Fathers converted it into the "Feast of the
Resurrection," which could not be kept too joyously. The
"Sabbatismus" of the Sabbatarian Protestant who keeps holy the
wrong day is a marvellous perversion and the Sunday feast of
France, Italy, and Catholic countries generally is far more
logical than the mortification day of England and the so-called
Reformed countries.

[FN#450]  Harais, plur. of Harisah: see vol. i. 131.

[FN#451]  It would have been cooked on our Thursday night, or the
Jewish Friday night and would be stale and indigestible on the
next day.

[FN#452]  Marw (Margiana), which the Turkomans pronounce "Mawr,"
is derived by Bournouf from the Sansk. Maru or Marw; and by Sir
H. Rawlinson from Marz or Marj, the Lat. Margo; Germ. Mark;
English March; Old French Marche and Neo-Lat. Marca. So Marzban,
a Warden of the Marches: vol. iii. 256. The adj. is not Marazi,
as stated in vol. iii. 222; but Marwazi, for which see Ibn
Khallikan, vol. i. p. 7, etc.: yet there are good writers who use
"Marazi" as Razi for a native of Rayy.

[FN#453]  i.e. native of Rayy city. See vol. iv. 104.

[FN#454]  Normally used for fuel and at times by funny men to be
put into sweetmeats by way of practical joke: these are called
"Nukl-i-Pishkil"=goat-dung bonbons. The tale will remind old
Anglo-Indians of the two Bengal officers who were great at such
"sells" and who "swopped" a spavined horse for a broken-down
"buggy."

[FN#455]  In the text "khanadik," ditches, trenches; probably (as
Mr. Payne suggests) a clerical or typographical error for
"Fanadik," inns or caravanserais; the plural of "Funduk" (Span.
Fonda), for which see vol. viii. 184.

[FN#456]  This sentence is supplied by Mr. Payne to remedy the
incoherence of the text. Moslems are bound to see True Believers
decently buried and the poor often beg alms for the funeral. Here
the tale resembles the opening of Hajji Baba by Mr. Morier, that
admirable picture of Persian manners and morals.

[FN#457]  Arab. "Al-ajr" which has often occurred.

[FN#458]  Arab. "Hanut," i.e., leaves of the lotus-tree to be
infused as a wash for the corpse; camphor used with cotton to
close the mouth and other orifices; and, in the case of a wealthy
man, rose-water, musk, ambergris, sandal-wood, and lignaloes for
fumigation.

[FN#459]  Which always begin with four "Takbirs" and differ in
many points from the usual orisons. See Lane (M. E. chapt.
xxviii.) who is, however, very superficial upon an intricate and
interesting subject. He even neglects to mention the number of
Ruk'at (bows) usual at Cairo and the absence of prostration
(sujud) for which see vol. ii. 10.

[FN#460]  Thus requiring all the ablutional offices to be
repeated. The Shaykh, by handling the corpse, became ceremonially
impure and required "Wuzu" before he could pray either at home or
in the Mosque.

[FN#461]  The Shaykh had left it when he went out to perform
Wuzu.

[FN#462]  Arab. "Satl"=the Lat. and Etruscan "Situla" and
"Situlus," a water-pot.

[FN#463]  Arab. "Lahd, Luhd," the niche or cell hollowed out in
the side of the oblong trench: here the corpse is deposited and
covered with palm-fronds etc. to prevent the earth touching it.
See my Pilgrimage ii. 304.

[FN#464]  For the incredible amount of torture which Eastern
obstinacy will sometimes endure, see Al-Mas'udi's tale of the
miserable little old man who stole the ten purses, vol. viii. 153
et seq.

[FN#465]  Arab. "Jaridah" (whence the Jarid-game) a palm-frond
stripped of its leaves and used for a host of purposes besides
flogging, chairs, sofas, bedsteads, cages, etc. etc. Tales of
heroism in "eating stick" are always highly relished by the lower
orders of Egyptians who pride themselves upon preferring the
severest bastinado to paying the smallest amount of "rint."

[FN#466]  Arab. "Nawus," the hollow tower of masonry with a
grating over the central well upon which the Magian corpse is
placed to be torn by birds of prey: it is kept up by the Parsi
population of Bombay and is known to Europeans as the "Tower of
Silence." Nais and Nawus also mean a Pyrethrum, a fire-temple and
have a whimsical resemblance to the Greek     .

[FN#467]  For Munkar and Nakir, the Interrogating Angels, see
vol. v. iii. According to Al-Mas'udi (chapt. xxxi.) these names
were given by the Egyptians to the thirteenth and fourteenth
cubits marked on the Nilometer which, in his day, was expected to
show seventeen.

[FN#468]  The text (xi. 227) has "Tannur"=an oven, evidently a
misprint for "Kubur"=tombs.

[FN#469]  Arab. "'An Abi"=(a propitiatory offering) for my
father. So in Marocco the "Powder-players" dedicate a shot to a
special purpose or person, crying "To my sweetheart!" "To my
dead!" "To my horse!" etc.

[FN#470]  For this formula see vol. i. 65. It is technically
called "Haukalah" and "Haulakah," words in the third conjugation
of increased triliterals, corresponding with the quadriliteral
radicals and possessing the peculiar power of Kasr=abbreviation.
Of this same class is Basmalah (vol. v. 206; ix. 1).

[FN#471]  This scene with the watch would be relished in the
coffee-house, where the tricks of robbers, like a gird at the
police, are always acceptable.

[FN#472]  Arab. "La af'al"; more commonly Ma af'al. Ma and La are
synonymous negative particles, differing, however, in
application. Ma (Gr.   ) precedes definites, or indefinites: La
and Lam (Gr.   ) only indefinites as "La ilaha" etc.

[FN#473]  Alluding to the proverb, "What hast thou left behind
thee, O Asam?" i.e., what didst thou see?

[FN#474]  Arab. "Sayrafi," s.s. as "Sarraf': see vol. i. 210.

[FN#475]  Arab. "Al-Ma'rafah"=the place where the mane grows.

[FN#476]  i.e. though the ass remain on thy hands.

[FN#477]  "Halves," i.e. of dirhams: see vol. ii. 37.

[FN#478]  Arab. "Taannafu,"=the Germ. lange Nase.

[FN#479]  About forty shillings.

[FN#480]  About L220.

[FN#481]  Characteristically Eastern and Moslem is this action of
the neighbours and bystanders. A walk through any Oriental city
will show a crowd of people screaming and gesticulating, with
thundering yells and lightning glances, as if about to close in
mortal fight, concerning some matter which in no way concerns
them. Our European cockneys and badauds mostly content themselves
with staring and mobbing.

[FN#482]  Arab. "Muruwwah," lit. manliness, especially in the
sense of generosity. So the saying touching the "Miyan," or
Moslem of India:--

     Fi 'l-riuz Kuwwah:
     Fi 'I Hindi muruwwah.

     When rice have strength, you'll haply find,
     In Hindi man, a manly mind.

[FN#483]  i.e. His claim is just and reasonable.

[FN#484]  I have noted (vol. i. 17) that good Moslems shun a
formal oath, although "by Allah!" is ever on their tongues. This
they seem to have borrowed from Christianity, which expressly
forbade it, whilst Christians cannot insist upon it too much. The
scandalous scenes lately enacted in a certain legislative
assembly because an M.P. did not believe in a practice denounced
by his creed, will be the wonder and ridicule of our descendants.

[FN#485]  Most Arabs believe that the black cloud which sometimes
produces, besides famine, contagious fevers and pestilence, like
that which in 1799 depopulated the cities and country of Barbary,
is led by a king locust, the Sultan Jarad.

[FN#486]  The text is hopelessly corrupt, and we have no other
with which to collate. Apparently a portion of the tale has
fallen out, making a non-sens of its ending, which suggests that
the kite gobbled up the two locusts at her ease, and left the
falcon to himself.

[FN#487]  The lines have occurred in vol. i. 265. I quote Mr.
Payne.

[FN#488]  The fabliau is a favourite in the East; this is the
third time it has occurred with minor modifications. Of course
the original was founded on fact, and the fact was and is by no
means uncommon.

[FN#489]  This would hardly be our Western way of treating a
proposal of the kind; nor would the European novelist neglect so
grand an opportunity for tall-talk.

[FN#490]  This is a rechauffe of "The House with the Belvedere;"
see vol. vi. 188.

[FN#491]  Arab. "Masturah,"=veiled, well-guarded, confined in the
Harem.

[FN#492]  Arab. "'Ajuz nahs"=an old woman so crafty that she was
a calamity to friends and foes.

[FN#493]  Here, as in many places the text is painfully concise:
the crone says only, "The Wuzu for the prayer!"

[FN#494]  I have followed Mr. Payne who supplies this sentence to
make the Tale run smoothly.

[FN#495]  i.e. the half of the marriage-settlement due to the
wife on divorcement and whatever monies he may have borrowed of
her.

[FN#496]  Here we find the vulgar idea of a rape, which is that a
man can, by mere force, possess a woman against her will. I
contend that this is impossible unless he use drugs like
chloroform or violence, so as to make the patient faint or she be
exceptionally weak. "Good Queen Bess" hit the heart of the
question when she bade Lord High Chancellor sheath his sword, she
holding the scabbard-mouth before him and keeping it in constant
motion. But it often happens that the woman, unless she have a
loathing for her violator, becomes infected with the amorous
storge, relaxes her defense, feels pleasure in the outer contact
of the parts and almost insensibly allows penetration and
emission. Even conception is possible in such cases as is proved
in that curious work, "The Curiosities of Medical Experience."

[FN#497]  i.e. thou wilt have satisfied us all three.

[FN#498]  Here I follow Mr. Payne who has skilfully fine-drawn
the holes in the original text.

[FN#499]  See vol. vii. 363; ix. 238.

[FN#500]  Arab. "Musalla," which may be either a praying carpet,
a pure place in a house, or a small chapel like that near Shiraz
which Hafiz immortalised,

"Bring, boy, the sup that's in the cup; in highest Heaven man
ne'er shall find
Such watery marge as Ruknabad, MusalIa's mazes rose entwined."

[FN#501]  Arab. "Ihtida,"=divine direction to Huda or salvation.
The old bawd was still dressed as a devotee, and keeps up the
cant of her caste. No sensible man in the East ever allows a
religious old woman to pass his threshold.

[FN#502]  In this tale "poetical justice" is neglected, but the
teller skilfully caused the wife to be ravished and not to be a
particeps criminis. The lover escapes scot-free because Moslems,
as well as Hindus, hold that the amourist under certain
conditions is justified in obtaining his object by fair means or
foul. See p. 147 of "Early Ideas, a Group of Hindoo Stories,"
collected and collated by Anaryan: London, Allens, 1881.

[FN#503]  This is supplied from the "Tale of the King and his
Wazir's Wife," vol. vi. 129.

[FN#504]  Arab. "Ibl," a specific name: it is presently opposed
to "Nakah," a she-dromedary, and "Rahilah," a riding-camel.

[FN#505]  Here "Amsaytu" is used in its literal sense "I evened"
(came at evening), and this is the case with seven such verbs,
Asbaha, Amsa, Azha, Azhara, A'tama, Zalla, and Bata, which either
conjoin the sense of the sentence with their respective times,
morning, evening, forenoon, noon and the first sundown watch, all
day and all night or are used "elegantly," as grammarians say,
for the simple "becoming" or "being."

[FN#506]  The Badawi dogs are as dangerous as those of Montenegro
but not so treacherous: the latter will sneak up to the stranger
and suddenly bite him most viciously. I once had a narrow escape
from an ignoble death near the slaughter-house of
Alexandria-Ramlah, where the beasts were unusually ferocious. A
pack assailed me at early dawn and but for an iron stick and a
convenient wall I should have been torn to pieces.

[FN#507]  These elopements are of most frequent occurrence: see
Pilgrimage iii. 52.

[FN#508]  The principal incidents, the loss and recovery of wife
and children, occur in the Story of the Knight Placidus (Gesta
Romanorum, cx.). But the ecclesiastical taleteller does not do
poetical justice upon any offenders, and he vilely slanders the
great Caesar, Trajan.

[FN#509]  i.e. a long time: the idiom has already been noticed.
In the original we have "of days and years and twelvemonths" in
order that "A'wam" (years) may jingle with "Ayyam" (days).

[FN#510]  Nothing can be more beautiful than the natural parks
which travellers describe on the coasts of tropical seas.

[FN#511]  Arab. "Khayyal" not only a rider but a good and a hard
rider. Hence the proverb "Al-Khayyal" kabr maftuh=uomo a cavallo
sepoltura aperta.

[FN#512]  i.e. the crew and the islanders.

[FN#513]  Arab. "Hadas," a word not easy to render. In grammar
Lumsden renders it by "event" and the learned Captain Lockett
(Miut Amil) in an awful long note (pp. 195 to 224) by "mode,"
grammatical or logical. The value of his disquisition is its
proving that, as the Arabs borrowed their romance from the
Persians, so they took their physics and metaphysics of grammar
and syntax; logic and science in general, from the Greeks.

[FN#514]  We should say the anchors were weighed and the canvas
spread.

[FN#515]  The rhymes are disposed in the quaintest way, showing
extensive corruption. Mr. Payne has ordered them into couplets
with a "bob" or refrain. I have followed suit, preserving the
original vagaries of rhymes.

[FN#516]  Arab. "Nuwab," broken plur. (that is, noun of
multitude) of Naubah, the Anglo-Indian Nowbut. This is applied to
the band playing at certain intervals before the gate of a Rajah
or high official.

[FN#517]  Arab. "Hajib"; Captain Trotter ("Our Mission to the
Court of Morocco in 1880": Edinburgh, Douglas, 1881) speaks,
passim, of the "cheery little Hajeb or Eyebrow." Really this is
too bad: why cannot travellers consult an Orientalist when
treating of Oriental subjects?

[FN#518]  Suicide is rare in Moslem lands, compared with India,
China, and similar "pagan" countries; for the Mussulman has the
same objection as the Christian "to rush into the presence of his
Creator," as if he could do so without the Creator's permission.
The Hindu also has some curious prejudices on the subject; he
will hang himself, but not by the neck, for fear lest his soul be
defiled by exiting through an impure channel. In England hanging
is the commonest form for men; then follow in due order drowning,
cutting or stabbing, poison, and gun-shot: women prefer drowning
(except in the cold months) and poison. India has not yet found a
Dr. Ogle to tabulate suicide; but the cases most familiar to old
Anglo-Indians are leaping down cliffs (as at Giruar), drowning,
and starving to death. And so little is life valued that a mother
will make a vow obliging her son to suicide himself at a certain
age.

[FN#519]  Arab. "Zarad-Khanah," before noticed: vol. vii. 363.
Here it would mean a temporary prison for criminals of high
degree. De Sacy, Chrestom, ii. 179.

[FN#520]  Arab. "'Adul," I have said, means in Marocco, that land
of lies and subterfuges, a public notary.

[FN#521]  This sentence is inserted by Mr. Payne to complete the
sense.

[FN#522]  i.e. he intended to marry her when time served.

[FN#523]  Arab. from Pers. Khwajah and Khawajat: see vol. vi. 46.

[FN#524]  Probably meaning by one mother whom he loved best of
all his wives: in the next page we read of their sister.

[FN#525]  Come down, i.e. from heaven.

[FN#526]  This is the Bresl. Edit.'s form of Shahryar=city-keeper
(like Marzban, guardian of the Marches), for city-friend. The
learned Weil has preferred it to Shahryar.

[FN#527]  Sic: in the Mac. Edit. "Shahrazad" and here making
nonsense of the word. It is regretable that the king's
reflections do not run at times as in this text: his compunctions
lead well up to the denouement.

[FN#528]  The careless text says "couplets." It has occurred in
vol. i. 149: so I quote Torrens (p. 149).

[FN#529]  In the text Salma is made to speak, utterly confusing
the dialogue.

[FN#530]  The well-known Baloch province beginning west of Sind:
the term is supposed to be a corruption of
Mahi-Khoran=Ichthyophagi. The reader who wishes to know more
about it will do well to consult "Unexplored Baluchistan," etc.
(Griffith and Farran, 1882), the excellent work of my friend Mr.
Ernest A. Floyer, long Chief of the Telegraphic Department,
Cairo.

[FN#531]  Meaning the last city in Makran before entering Sind.
Al-Sharr would be a fancy name, "The Wickedness."

[FN#532]  i.e. think of nothing but his present peril.

[FN#533]  Arab. "Munkati'ah"=lit. "cut off" (from the weal of the
world). See Pilgrimage i. 22.

[FN#534]  The lines are in vol. i. 207 and iv. 189. 1 here quote
Mr. Payne.

[FN#535]  I have another proposal to make.

[FN#536]  i.e. In my heart's core: the figure has often occurred.

[FN#537]  These sudden elevations, so common in the East and not
unknown to the West in the Napoleonic days, explain how the
legend of "Joanna Papissa" (Pope John XIII), who succeeded Leo
IV. in A.D. 855 and was succeeded by Benedict III., found ready
belief amongst the enemies of papacy. She was an English woman
born in Germany who came to Rome and professed theology with
eclat, wherefore the people enthroned her. "Pope Joan" governed
with exemplary wisdom, but during a procession on Rogation Sunday
she was delivered of a fine boy in the street: some make her die
on the spot; others declare that she perished in prison.

[FN#538]  That such things should happen in times of famine is
only natural; but not at other seasons. This abomination on the
part of the butcher is, however, more than once alluded toin The
Nights: see vol. i. 332.

[FN#539]  Opinions differ as to the site of this city, so
celebrated in the mediaeval history of Al-Islam: most probably it
stood where Hyderabad of Sind now is. The question has been ably
treated by Sir Henry M. Elliot in his "History of India," edited
from his posthumous papers by Professor Dowson.

[FN#540]  Which, by-the-by, the average Eastern does with even
more difficulty than the average European. For the most part the
charge to secrecy fixes the matter in his mind even when he has
forgotten that it is to be kept secret. Hence the most unpleasant
results.

[FN#541]  Such an act appears impossible, and yet history tells
us of a celebrated Sufi, Khayr al-Nassaj (the Weaver), who being
of dark complexion was stopped on return from his pilgrimage at
Kufah by a stranger that said, "Thou art my negro slave and thy
name is Khayr." He was kept at the loom for years, till at last
the man set him free, and simply said, "Thou wast not my slave"
(Ibn Khall. i. 513).

[FN#542]  These lines have occurred before. I quote Mr. Payne for
variety.

[FN#543]  Arab. "Tasill saliata 'l-Munkat'in"=lit. "raining on
the drouth-hardened earth of the cut-off." The metaphor is
admissible in the eyes of an Arab who holds water to be the
chiefest of blessings, and makes it synonymous with bounty and
beneficence."

[FN#544]  Possibly this is said in mere fun; but, as Easterns are
practical physiognomists, it may hint the fact that a large nose
in womankind is the sign of a masculine nature.

[FN#545]  Arab. "Zakat wa Sadakat,"=lit. paying of poor rate and
purifying thy property by almsdeeds. See vol. i. 339.

[FN#546]  I have noted (i. 293) that Kamis (     , Chemise,
Cameslia, Camisa) is used in the Hindostani and Bengali dialects.
Like its synonyms praetexta and shift, it has an equivocal meaning
and here probably signifies the dress peculiar to Arab devotees
and devout beggars.

[FN#547]  I omit here and elsewhere the parenthetical formula
"Kala al-Rawi," etc.=The Story-teller sayeth, reminding the
reader of its significance in a work collected from the mouths of
professional Tale-tellers and intended mainly for their own use.

[FN#548]  The usual sign of emotion, already often mentioned.

[FN#549]  It being no shame to Moslems if a slave become King.

[FN#550]  Arab. "Tarbiyati," i.e., he was brought up in my house.

[FN#551]  There is no Salic law amongst Moslems; but the Rasm or
custom of AlIslam, established by the succession of the four
first Caliphs, to the prejudice of Ayishah and other masterful
women would be a strong precedent against queenly rule. It is the
reverse with the Hindus who accept a Rani as willingly as a Rajah
and who believe with Europeans that when kings reign women rule,
and vice versa. To the vulgar Moslem feminine government appears
impossible, and I was once asked by an Afghan, "What would happen
if the queen were in childbed?"

[FN#552]  Arab. "Khutbah," the sermon preached from the pulpit
(Mimbar) after the congregational prayers on Friday noon. It is
of two kinds, for which see Lane, M.E., chap. iii. This public
mention of his name and inscribing it upon the newly-minted money
are the special prerogatives of the Moslem king: hence it often
happens that usurpers cause a confusion of Khutbah and coinage.

[FN#553]  For a specimen of which, blowing a man up with bellows,
see Al-Mas'udi, chap. cxxiii.

[FN#554]  i.e. a long time: the idiom has been noted before more
than once.

[FN#555]  i.e. with what he had heard and what he was promised.

[FN#556]  Arab. "Shakhs mafsud," i.e. an infidel.

[FN#557]  Arab. "Bunud," plur. of Persian "band"=hypocrisy,
deceit.

[FN#558]  Arab. "Buruj" pl. of Burj. lit.=towers, an astrological
term equivalent to our "houses" or constellations which form the
Zodiacal signs surrounding the heavens as towers gird a city; and
applied also to the 28 lunar Mansions. So in Al-Hariri (Ass. of
Damascus) "I swear by the sky with its towers," the incept of
Koran chapt. lxxxv.; see also chapts. xv. 26 and xxv. 62. "Burj"
is a word with a long history: {Greek} burg, burgh, etc.

[FN#559]  Arab. "Bundukah"=a little bunduk, nut, filbert, pellet,
rule, musket bullet.

[FN#560]  See John Raister's "Booke of the Seven Planets; or,
Seven Wandering Motives," London, 1598.

[FN#561]  i.e. for the king whom I love as my own soul.

[FN#562]  The Bresl. Edit. (xi. 318-21) seems to assume that the
tales were told in the early night before the royal pair slept.
This is no improvement; we prefer to think that the time was
before peep of day when Easterns usally awake and have nothing to
do till the dawn-prayer.

[FN#563]  See vol. ii. 161.

[FN#564]  Arab. Al-Fakhir.  No wonder that the First Hand who
moulded the Man-mud is a lieu commun in Eastern thought.  The Pot
and the Potter began with the old Egyptians.  "Sitting as a
potter at the wheel, god Cneph (in Philae) moulds clay, and gives
the spirit of life (the Genesitic "breath") to the nostrils of
Osiris."  Then we meet him in the Vedas, the Being, "by whom the
fictile vase is formed; the clay out of which it is fabricated."
We find him next in Jeremiah (xviii. 2) "Arise and go down unto
the Potter's house," etc., and in Romans (ix. 20), "Hath not the
Potter power over the clay?"  He appears in full force in Omar-i-
Khayyam (No. xxxvii.):--

     For I remember stopping by the way
     To watch a Potter thumping his wet Clay:
          An with its all obliterated Tongue
     I murmur'd-"Gently, Brother, gently, pray!"

Lastly the Potter shows in the Kasidah of Haji Abdu al-Yezid
(p.4):--

     "The first of pots the Potter made by Chrysorrhoas' blue-
green wave;
     Methinks I see him smile to see what guerdon to the world he
gave.

                   The Translator's Foreword.



After offering my cordial thanks to friends and subscribers who
have honoured "The Thousand Nights and a Night" (Kama Shastra
Society) with their patronage and approbation, I would inform
them that my "Anthropological Notes" are by no means exhausted,
and that I can produce a complete work only by means of a
somewhat extensive Supplement.  I therefore propose to print (not
publish), for private circulation only, five volumes, bearing the
title–

                      Supplemental Nights
                         to the book of
                The Thousand Nights and a Night

This volume and its successor (Nos. i. and ii.) contain Mr. John
Payne's Tales from the Arabic; his three tomes being included in
my two.  The stories are taken from the Breslau Edition where
they are distributed among the volumes between Nos. iv and xii.,
and from the Calcutta fragment of 1814.  I can say little for the
style of the story-stuff contained in this Breslau text, which
has been edited with phenomenal incuriousness.  Many parts are
hopelessly corrupted, whilst at present we have no means of
amending the commissions and of supplying the omissions by
comparison with other manuscripts.  The Arabic is not only
faulty, but dry and jejune, comparing badly with that of the
"Thousand Nights and a Night," as it appears in the Macnaghten
and the abridged Bulak Texts.  Sundry of the tales are futile;
the majority has little to recommend it, and not a few require a
diviner rather than a translator.  Yet they are valuable to
students as showing the different sources and the heterogeneous
materials from and of which the great Saga-book has been
compounded.  Some are, moreover, striking and novel, especially
parts of the series entitled King Shah Bakht and his Wazir Al-
Rahwan (pp. 191-355).  Interesting also is the Tale of the "Ten
Wazirs" (pp. 55-155), marking the transition of the Persian
Bakhtiyár-Námeh into Arabic.  In this text also and in this only
is found Galland's popular tale "Abou-Hassan; or, the Sleeper
Awakened," which I have entitled "The Sleeper and the Waker."

In the ten volumes of "The Nights" proper, I mostly avoided
parallels of folk-lore and fabliaux which, however interesting
and valuable to scholars, would have over-swollen the bulk of a
work especially devoted to Anthropology.  In the "Supplementals,"
however, it is otherwise; and, as Mr. W.A. Clouston, the
"Storiologist," has obligingly agreed to collaborate with me, I
shall pay marked attention to this subject, which will thus form
another raison d'ête for the additional volumes.

Richard F. Burton

Junior Travellers' Club,
December 1, 1886






                      Supplemental Nights

                       To The Book Of The

                  Thousand Nights And A Night






                The Sleeper and the Waker.[FN#1]




It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that there was once at
Baghdad, in the Caliphate of Harun al-Rashid, a man and a
merchant, who had a son Abú al-Hasan-al-Khalí'a by name.[FN#2]
The merchant died leaving great store of wealth to his heir who
divided it into two equal parts, whereof he laid up one and spent
of the other half; and he fell to companying with Persians[FN#3]
and with the sons of the merchants and he gave himself up to good
drinking and good eating, till all the wealth[FN#4] he had with
him was wasted and wantoned; whereupon he betook himself to his
friends and comrades and cup-companions and expounded to them his
case, discovering to them the failure of that which was in his
hand of wealth.  But not one of them took heed of him or even
deigned answer him.  So he returned to his mother (and indeed his
spirit was broken) and related to her that which had happened to
him and what had befallen him from his friends, how they had
neither shared with him nor required him with speech.  Quoth she,
"O Abu al-Hasan, on this wise are the sons[FN#5] of this time: an
thou have aught, they draw thee near to them,[FN#6] and if thou
have naught, they put thee away from them."  And she went on to
condole with him, what while he bewailed himself and his tears
flowed and he repeated these lines:--

"An wane my wealth, no mane will succour me, * When my wealth
     waxeth all men friendly show:
How many a friend, for wealth showed friendliness * Who, when my
     wealth departed, turned to foe!"

Then he sprang up and going to the place wherein was the other
half of his good, took it and lived with it well; and he sware
that he would never again consort with a single one of those he
had known, but would company only with the stranger nor entertain
even him but one night and that, when it morrowed, he would never
know him more.  Accordingly he fell to sitting every eventide on
the bridge over Tigris and looking at each one who passed by him;
and if he saw him to be a stranger, he made friends with him and
caroused with him all night till morning.  Then he dismissed him
and would never more salute him with the Salam nor ever more drew
near unto him neither invited him again.  Thus he continued to do
for the space of a full year, till, one day, while he sat on the
bridge, as was his wont, expecting who should come to him so he
might take him and pass the night with him, behold, up came the
Caliph and Masrur, the Sworder of his vengeance[FN#7] disguised
in merchants dress, according to their custom.  So Abu al-Hasan
looked at them and rising, because he knew them not, asked them,
"What say ye?  Will ye go with me to my dwelling-place, so ye may
eat what is ready and drink what is at hand, to wit, platter-
bread[FN#8] and meat cooked and wine strained?"  The Caliph
refused this, but he conjured him and said to him, "Allah upon
thee, O my lord, go with me, for thou art my guest this night,
and baulk not my hopes of thee!"  And he ceased not to press him
till he consented; whereat Abu al-Hasan rejoiced and walking on
before him, gave not over talking with him till they came to his
house and he carried the Caliph into the saloon.  Al-Rashid
entered a hall such as an thou sawest it and gazedst upon its
walls, thou hadst beheld marvels; and hadst thou looked narrowly
at its water-conduits thou would have seen a fountain cased with
gold.  The Caliph made his man abide at the door; and, as soon as
he was seated, the host brought him that eating might be grateful
to him.  Then he removed the tray and they washed their hands and
the Commander of the Faithful sat down again; whereupon Abu al-
Hasan set on the drinking vessels and seating himself by his
side, fell to filling and giving him to drink[FN#9] and
entertaining him with discourse.  And when they had drunk their
sufficiency the host called for a slave-girl like a branch of Ban
who took a lute and sang to it these two couplets:--

"O thou aye dwelling in my heart, * Whileas thy form is far from
     sight,
Thou art my sprite my me unseen, * Yet nearest near art thou, my
     sprite."

His hospitality pleased the Caliph and the goodliness of his
manners, and he said to him, O youth, who art thou?  Make me
acquainted with thyself, so I may requite thee thy kindness."
But Abu al-Hasan smiled and said, "O my lord, far be it, alas!
that what is past should again come to pass and that I company
with thee at other time than this time!"  The Prince of True
Believers asked, "Why so? and why wilt thou not acquaint me with
thy case?" and Abu al-Hasan answered, "Know, O my lord, that my
story is strange and that there is a cause for this affair."
Quoth Al-Rashid, "And what is the cause?" and quoth he, "The
cause hath a tail."  The Caliph[FN#10] laughed at his words and
Abu al-Hasan said, "I will explain to thee this saying by the
tale of the Larrikin and the Cook.  So hear thou, O my lord."


Story of the Larrikin[FN#11] and the Cook

One of the ne'er-do-wells found himself one fine morning without
aught and the world was straightened upon him and patience failed
him; so he lay down to
