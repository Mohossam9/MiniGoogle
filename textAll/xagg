dancing round the idol played a prime part;
and Lucian of "saltation" says, dancing was from the beginning
and coeval with the ancient god, Love. But man danced with joy
before he worshipped, and, when he invented a systematic
saltation, he made it represent two things, and only two things,
love and war, in most primitive form, courtship and fighting.

[FN#322] Two adjoining ground-waves in Meccah. For these and for
the places subsequently mentioned the curious will consult my
Pilgrimage, iii. 226, etc.

[FN#323] The 'Umrah or lesser Pilgrimage, I have noted, is the
ceremony performed in Meccah at any time out of the
pilgrim-season proper, i.e. between the eighth and tenth days of
the twelfth lunar month Zu 'l-Hijjah. It does not entitle the
Moslem to be called Hajj (pilgrim) or Haji as Persians and
Indians corrupt the word.

[FN#324] I need hardly note that Mohammed borrowed his
pilgrimage-practices from the pagan Arabs who, centuries before
his day, danced around the Meccan Ka'abah. Nor can he be blamed
for having perpetuated a Gentile rite, if indeed it be true that
the Ka'abah contained relics of Abraham and Ishmael.

[FN#325] On first sighting Meccah. See Night xci.

[FN#326] Arab. "Tawaf:" the place is called Mataf and the guide
Mutawwif. (Pilgrimage, iii. 193, 205.) The seven courses are
termed Ashwat.

[FN#327] Stoning the Devil at Mina. (Pilgrimage, iii. 282.) Hence
Satan's title "the Stoned" (lapidated not castrated).

[FN#328] Koran viii. 66; in the chapter entided "Spoil," and
relating mainly to the "day of Al-Bedr.

[FN#329] Arab. "AI-Ikalah"= cancelling: Mr. Payne uses the
technical term "resiliation."

[FN#330] Freedman of Abdallah, son of the Caliph Omar and noted
as a traditionist.

[FN#331] i.e. at a profit: the exchange must be equal--an
ordinance intended to protect the poor. Arabs have strange
prejudices in these matters; for instance it disgraces a Badawi
to take money for milk.

[FN#332] Arab. "Jama'ah," which in theology means the Greek
        , our "Church," the congregation of the Faithful under a
lawful head. Hence the Sunnis call themselves "People of the
Sunnat and Jama'at." In the text it is explained as "Ulfat" or
intimacy.

[FN#333] Arab. "Al-Khalil," i.e. of Allah=Abraham. Mohammed,
following Jewish tradition, made Abraham rank second amongst the
Prophets, inferior only to himself and superior to Hazrat
Isa=Jesus. I have noted that Ishmael the elder son succeeded his
father. He married Da'alah bint Muzaz bin Omar, a Jurhamite, and
his progeny abandoning Hebrew began to speak Arabic (ta'arraba);
hence called Muta'arribah or Arabised Arabs. (Pilgrimage iii.
190.) He died at Meccah and was buried with his mother in the
space North of the Ka'abah called Al-Hijr which our writers
continue to confuse with the city Al-Hijr. (Ibid. 165-66.)

[FN#334] This ejaculation, "In the name of Allah" is, I have
noted, equivalent to "saying grace." If neglected it is a sin and
entails a curse.

[FN#335] The ceremonious posture is sitting upon the shin-bones,
not tailor-fashion; and "bolting food" is a sign of boorishness.

[FN#336] Arab. "Zidd," the word is a fair specimen of Arabic
ambiguity meaning primarily opposite or contrary (as virtue to
vice), secondarily an enemy or a friend (as being opposite to an
enemy).

[FN#337] "The whole earth (shall be) but His handful on the
Resurrection day and in His right hand shall the Heaven be rolled
up (or folded together)."-Koran xxxix. 67.

[FN#338] See Night lxxxi.

[FN#339] Koran lxxviii. 19.

[FN#340] Arab. "Al-Munafik," technically meaning one who
outwardly professes Al-Islam while inwardly hating it. Thus the
word is by no means synonymous with our "hypocrite," hypocrisy
being the homage vice pays to virtue; a homage, I may observe,
nowhere rendered more fulsomely than among the so-called
Anglo-Saxon race.

[FN#341] Arab. "Tawakkul ala 'llah": in the imperative the phrase
is vulgarly used="Be off!"

[FN#342] i.e. ceremonial impurity which is sui generis, a very
different thing from general dirtiness.

[FN#343] A thick beard is one which does not show the skin;
otherwise the wearer is a "Kausaj;" in Pers. "Kuseh." See vol.
iii., 246.

[FN#344] Arab. "Al-Khutnah." Nowhere commanded in the Koran and
being only a practice of the Prophet, the rite is not
indispensable for converts, especially the aged and the sick. Our
ideas upon the subject are very hazy, for modern "niceness"
allows a "Feast of the Circumcision," but no discussion thereon.
Moses (alias Osarsiph) borrowed the rite from the Egyptian
hierophants who were all thus "purified"; the object being to
counteract the over-sensibility of the "sixth sense" and to
harden the glans against abrasions and infection by exposure to
air and friction against the dress. Almost all African tribes
practise it but the modes vary and some are exceedingly curious:
I shall notice a peculiarly barbarous fashion called Al-Salkh
(the flaying) still practised in the Arabian province Al-Asir.
(Pilgrimage iii. 80.) There is a difference too between the
Hebrew and the Moslem rite. The Jewish operator, after snipping
off the foreskin, rips up the prepuce with his sharp thumb-nails
so that the external cutis does not retract far from the
internal; and the wound, when healed, shows a narrow ring of
cicatrice. This ripping is not done by Moslems. They use a stick
as a probe passed round between glans and prepuce to ascertain
the extent of the frenum and that there is no abnormal adhesion.
The foreskin is then drawn forward and fixed by the forceps, a
fork of two bamboo splints, five or six inches long by a quarter
thick, or in some cases an iron like our compasses. This is tied
tightly over the foreskin so as to exclude about an inch and a
half of the prepuce above and three quarters below. A single
stroke of the razor drawn directly downwards removes the skin.
The slight bleeding is stopped by burnt rags or ashes and healed
with cerates, pledgets and fumigations. Thus Moslem circumcision
does not prevent the skin retracting.

[FN#345] Of these 6336 versets only some 200 treat on law, civil
and ceremonial, fiscal and political, devotional and ceremonial,
canonical and ecclesiastical.

[FN#346] The learned young woman omitted Ukhnukh=Enoch, because
not in Koran; and if she denoted him by "Idris," the latter is
much out of place.

[FN#347] Some say grandson of Shem. (Koran vii. 71.)

[FN#348] Koran vii. 63, etc.

[FN#349] Father-in-law of Moses. (Koran vii. 83.)

[FN#350] Who is the last and greatest of the twenty-five.

[FN#351] See Night ccccxxxviii.

[FN#352] Koran ii., whose 256th Ayah is the far-famed and sublime
Throne-verse which begins "Allah! there is no god but He, the
Living, the Eternal One, whom nor slumber nor sleep seizeth on!"
The trivial name is taken from the last line, "His throne
overstretcheth Heaven and Earth and to Him their preservation is
no burden for He is the most Highest, the Supreme." The lines are
often repeated in prayers and engraved on agates, etc., as
portable talismans.

[FN#353] Koran ii. 159.

[FN#354] Koran xvi. 92. The verset ends with, "He warneth you, so
haply ye may be mindful."

[FN#355] Koran lxx. 38.

[FN#356] Koran xxxix. 54.

[FN#357] The Sunnis hold that the "Anbiya" (=prophets, or rather
announcers of Allah's judgments) were not sinless. But this dogma
is branded as most irreverent and sinful by the Shi'ahs or
Persian "followers of Ali," who make capital out of this
blasphemy and declare that if any prophet sinned he sinned only
against himself.

[FN#358] Koran xii. 18.

[FN#359] Koran ii. 107.

[FN#360] Koran ii. 57. He (Allah) does not use the plurale
majestatis.

[FN#361] Koran ii. 28.

[FN#362] Koran xvi. 100. Satan is stoned in the Mina or Muna
basin (Night ccccxlii.) because he tempted Abraham to disobey the
command of Allah by refusing to sacrifice Ishmael. (Pilgrimage
iii. 248.)

[FN#363] It may also mean "have recourse to God."

[FN#364] Abdallah ibn Abbas, before noticed, first cousin of
Mohammed and the most learned of the Companions. See D'Herbelot.

[FN#365] Koran xcvi., "Blood-clots," 1 and 2. "Read" may mean
"peruse the revelation" (it was the first Koranic chapter
communicated to Mohammed), or "recite, preach."

[FN#366] Koran xxvii. 30. Mr. Rodwell (p.1) holds to the old idea
that the "Basmalah" is of Jewish origin, taught to the Kuraysh by
Omayyah, of Taif, the poet and Hanif (convert).

[FN#367] Koran ix.: this was the last chapter revealed and the
only one revealed entire except verse 110.

[FN#368] Ali was despatched from Al-Medinah to Meccah by the
Prophet on his own slit-eared camel to promulgate this chapter;
and meeting the assembly at Al-'Akabah he also acquainted them
with four things; (1) No Infidel may approach the Meccah temple;
(2) naked men must no longer circut the Ka'abah; (3) only Moslems
enter Paradise, and (4) public faith must be kept.

[FN#369] Dictionaries give the word "Basmalah" (=saying
Bismillah); but the common pronunciation is "Bismalah."

[FN#370] Koran xvii. 110, a passage revealed because the
Infidels, hearing Mohammed calling upon The Compassionate,
imagined that Al-Rahman was other deity but Allah. The "names"
have two grand divisions, Asma Jalali, the fiery or terrible
attributes, and the Asma Jamali (airy, watery, earthy or)
amiable. Together they form the Asma al-Husna or glorious
attributes, and do not include the Ism al-A'azam, the ineffable
name which is known only to a few.

[FN#371] Koran ii. 158.

[FN#372] Koran xcvi. before noticed.

[FN#373] A man of Al-Medinah, one of the first of Mohammed's
disciples.

[FN#374] Koran lxxiv. 1, etc., supposed to have been addressed by
Gabriel to Mohammed when in the cave of Hira or Jabal Nur. He
returned to his wife Khadijah in sore terror at the vision of one
sitting on a throne between heaven and earth, and bade her cover
him up. Whereupon the Archangel descended with this text,
supposed to be the first revealed. Mr. Rodwell (p. 3) renders it,
"O thou enwrapped in thy mantle!" and makes it No. ii. after a
Fatrah or silent interval of six months to three years.

[FN#375] There are several versets on this subject (chapts. ii.
and xxx.)

[FN#376] Koran cx. 1.

[FN#377] The third Caliph; the "Writer of the Koran."

[FN#378] Koran, v. 4. Sale translates "idols." Mr. Rodwell, "On
the blocks (or shafts) of Stone," rude altars set by the pagan
Arabs before their dwellings.

[FN#379] Koran, v. 116. The words are put into the mouth of
Jesus.

[FN#380] The end of the same verse.

[FN#381] Koran, v. 89. Supposed to have been revealed when
certain Moslems purposed to practise Christian asceticism,
fasting, watching, abstaining from women and sleeping on hard
beds. I have said Mohammed would have "no monkery in Al-Islam,"
but human nature willed otherwise. Mr. Rodwell prefers "Interdict
the healthful viands."

[FN#382] Koran, iv. 124.

[FN#383] Arab. "Mukri." "Kari" is one who reads the Koran to
pupils; the Mukri corrects them. "With the passage of the clouds"
= without a moment's hesitation.

[FN#384] The twenty-first, twenty-fourth and eighteenth Arabic
letters.

[FN#385] Arab. "Hizb." The Koran is divided into sixty portions,
answering to "Lessons" for convenience of public worship.

[FN#386] Arab. "Jalalah,"=saying Jalla Jalalu-hu=magnified be His
Majesty!, or glorified be His Glory.

[FN#387] Koran, xi. 50.

[FN#388] The partition-wall between Heaven and Hell which others
call Al-'Urf (in the sing. from the verb meaning he separated or
parted). The Jews borrowed from the Guebres the idea of a
partition between Heaven and Hell and made it so thin that the
blessed and damned can speak together. There is much dispute
about the population of Al-A'araf, the general idea being that
they are men who do not deserve reward in Heaven or punishment in
Hell. But it is not a "Purgatory" or place of expiating sins.

[FN#389] Koran, vii. 154.

[FN#390] A play on the word ayn, which means "eye" or the
eighteenth letter which in olden times had the form of a circle.

[FN#391] From misreading these words comes the absurd popular
belief of the moon passing up and down Mohammed's sleeves. George
B. Airy (The Athenaeum, Nov.29, 1884) justly objects to Sale's
translation "The hour of judgment approacheth" and translates
"The moon hath been dichotomised" a well-known astronomical term
when the light portion of the moon is defined in a strait line:
in other words when it is really a half-moon at the first and
third quarters of each lunation. Others understand, The moon
shall be split on the Last Day, the preterite for the future in
prophetic style. "Koran Moslems" of course understand it
literally.

[FN#392] Chapters liv., lv. and lvi.

[FN#393] We should say, not to utter, etc.

[FN#394] These well-known "humours of Hippocrates," which
reappear in the form of temperaments of European phrenology, are
still the base of Eastern therapeutics.

[FN#395] The doctrine of the three souls will be intelligible to
Spiritualists.

[FN#396] Arab. "Al-lami"=the l-shaped, curved, forked.

[FN#397] Arab. "Usus," our os sacrum because, being
incorruptible, the body will be built up thereon for
Resurrection-time. Hence Hudibras sings (iii. 2),

     "The learned Rabbis of the Jews
     Write there's a bone which they call leuz,
     I' the rump of man, etc."

It is the Heb. "Uz," whence older scholars derived os. Sale
(sect. iv.) called it "El Ajb, os coccygis or rump-bone."

[FN#398] Arab physiologists had difficulties in procuring
"subjects"; and usually practised dissection on the simiads.
Their illustrated books are droll; the figures have been copied
and recopied till they have lost all resemblance to the
originals.

[FN#399] The liver and spleen are held to be congealed blood.
Hence the couplet,

    "We are allowed two carrions (i.e. with throats uncut) and
         two bloods,
     The fish and the locust, the liver and the spleen."
(Pilgrimage iii. 92.)

[FN#400] This is perfectly true and yet little known to the
general.

[FN#401] Koran xvii. 39.

[FN#402] Arab. "Al-malikhuliya," proving that the Greeks then
pronounced the penultimate vowel according to the acute
accent ia; not as we slur it over. In old Hebrew we have the
transliteration of four Greek words; in the languages of
Hindostan many scores including names of places; and in Latin and
Arabic as many hundreds. By a scholar-like comparison of these
remains we should find little difficulty in establishing the true
Greek pronunciation since the days of Alexander the Great; and we
shall prove that it was pronounced according to accent and
emphatically not quantity. In the next century I presume English
boys will be taught to pronounce Greek as the Greeks do.

[FN#403] Educated Arabs can quote many a verse bearing upon
domestic medicine and reminding us of the lines bequeathed to
Europe by the School of Salerno. Such e.g. are;

     "After the noon-meal, sleep, although for moments twain;
     After the night-meal, walk, though but two steps be ta'en;
     And after swiving stale, though but two drops thou drain."

[FN#404] Arab. "Saridah" (Tharidah), also called "ghaut"=crumbled
bread and hashed meat in broth; or bread, milk and meat. The
Saridah of Ghassan, cooked with eggs and marrow, was held a
dainty dish: hence the Prophet's dictum.

[FN#405] Koran v. 92. "Lots"=games of chance and
"images"=statues.

[FN#406] Koran ii. 216. The word "Maysar" which I have rendered
"gambling" or gaming (for such is the modern application of the
word), originally meant what St. Jerome calls     æ      and
explains thereby the verse (Ezek. xxi. 22), "The King held in his
hand the lot of Jerusalem" i.e. the arrow whereon the city-name
was written. The Arabs use it for casting lots with ten azlam or
headless arrows (for dice) three being blanks and the rest
notched from one to seven. They were thrown by a "Zarib" or
punter and the stake was generally a camel. Amongst so excitable
a people as the Arabs, this game caused quarrels and bloodshed,
hence its prohibition: and the theologians, who everywhere and at
all times delight in burdening human nature, have extended the
command, which is rather admonitory than prohibitive, to all
games of chance. Tarafah is supposed to allude to this practice
in his Mu'allakah.

[FN#407] Liberal Moslems observe that the Koranic prohibition is
not absolute, with threat of Hell for infraction. Yet Mohammed
doubtless forbade all inebriatives and the occasion of his so
doing is well known. (Pilgrimage ii. 322.)

[FN#408] I have noticed this soured milk in Pilgrimage i. 362.

[FN#409] He does not say the "Caliph" or successor of his uncle
Mohammed.

[FN#410] The Jewish Korah (Numbers xvi.) fabled by the Koran
(xxviii. 76), following a Talmudic tradition, to have been a man
of immense wealth. The notion that lying with an old woman, after
the menses have ceased, is unwholesome, dates from great
antiquity; and the benefits of the reverse process were well
known to good King David. The faces of children who sleep with
their grandparents (a bad practice now waxing obsolete in
England), of a young wife married to an old man and of a young
man married to an old woman, show a peculiar wizened appearance,
a look of age overlaying youth which cannot be mistaken.

[FN#411] Arab. "Hindiba"(=endubium): the modern term is
Shakuriyah=chicoree. I believe it to be very hurtful to the eyes.

[FN#412] Arab. "Khuffash" and "Watwat": in Egypt a woman is
called "Watwatiyah" when the hair of her privities has been
removed by applying bats' blood. I have often heard of this; but
cannot understand how such an application can act depilatory.

[FN#413] Dictionaries render the word by "dragon, cockatrice."
The Badawin apply it to a variety of serpents mostly large and
all considered venomous.

[FN#414] Arab. "Zarr wa 'urwah," 1it.=handle. The button-hole, I
have said, is a modern invention; Urwah is also applied to the
loopshaped handle of the water-skin, for attachment of the
Allakah or suspensory thong.

[FN#415] Koran lxx. 40; see also the chapter following, v. 16.

[FN#416] Koran x. 5; the "her" refers to the sun.

[FN#417] Koran xxxvi. 40.

[FN#418] Koran xxii. 60.

[FN#419] Arab. "Manazil:" these are the Hindu "Nakshatra";
extensively used in meteorology even by Europeans unconsciously:
thus they will speak of the Elephantina-storm without knowing
anything of the lunar mansion so called. The names in the text
are successively Sharatan=two horns of the Ram; (2) the Ram's
belly; (3) the Pleiades; (4) Aldebaran; (5) three stars in
Orion's head; (6) ditto in Orion's shoulder; (7) two stars above
the Twins; (8) Lion's nose and first summer station; (9) Lion's
eye; (1O) Lion's forehead; (11) Lion's mane; (12) Lion's heart;
(13) the Dog, two stars in Virgo; (14) Spica Virginis; (15) foot
of Virgo; (16) horns of Scorpio; (17) the Crown; (18) heart of
Scorpio; (19) tail of Scorpio; (2O) stars in Pegasus; (21) where
no constellation appears; (22) the Slaughterer's luck; (23)
Glutton's luck; (24) Luck of Lucks, stars in Aquarius; (25) Luck
of Tents, stars in Aquarius; (26) the fore-lip or spout of Urn;
(27) hind lip of Urn; and (28) in navel of Fish's belly (Batn
al-Hut); of these 28, to each of the four seasons 7 are allotted.

[FN#420] The Hebrew absey, still used by Moslems in chronograms.
For mnemonic purposes the 28 letters are distributed into eight
words of which the first and second are Abjad and Hawwaz. The
last six letters in two words (Thakhiz and Zuzigh) are Arabian,
unknown to the Jews and not found in Syriac.

[FN#421] Arab. "Zindik;" properly, one who believes in two gods
(the old Persian dualism); in books an atheist, i.e. one who does
not believe in a god or gods; and, popularly, a free-thinker who
denies the existence of a Supreme Being, rejects revelation for
the laws of Nature imprinted on the heart of man and for humanity
in its widest sense. Hence he is accused of permitting incestuous
marriages and other abominations. We should now call him (for
want of something better) an Agnostic.

[FN#422] Koran xxxi. 34. The words may still be applied to
meteorologists especially of the scientific school. Even the
experienced (as the followers of the late Mathieu de la Drome)
reckon far more failures than successes. The Koranic passage
enumerates five things known only to Allah; Judgment-day; rain;
sex of child in womb; what shall happen to-morrow and where a man
shall die.

[FN#423] The fifth and seventh months (January and March) of the
Coptic year which, being solar, is still used by Arab and
Egyptian meteorologists. Much information thereon will be found
in the "Egyptian Calendar" by Mr. Mitchell, Alexandria, 1876. It
bears the appropriate motto "Anni certus modus apud solos semper
Egyptios fuit." (Macrobius.) See also Lane M.E., chapt. ix.

[FN#424] Vulg. Kiyak; the fourth month, beginning 9th--1Oth
December. The first month is Tut, commencing 1Oth--11th
September.

[FN#425] The 8th and 12th months partly corresponding with April
and August: Hatur is the 3rd (November) and AmshRr the 6th
(February).

[FN#426] Moslems have been compelled to adopt infidel names for
the months because Mohammed's Koranic rejection of Nasy or
intercalation makes their lunar months describe the whole circle
of the seasons in a cycle of about thirty-three and a half years.
Yet they have retained the terms which contain the original
motive of the denomination. The first month is Muharram, the
"Holy," because war was forbidden; it was also known as Safar No.
1. The second Safar="Emptiness," because during the heats
citizens left the towns and retired to Taif and other cool sites.
Rabi'a (first and second) alluded to the spring-pasturages;
Jumada (first and second) to the "hardening" of the dry ground
and, according to some, to the solidification, freezing, of the
water in the highlands. Rajab (No.7)="worshipping," especially by
sacrifice, is also known as Al-Asamm the deaf; because being
sacred, the rattle of arms was unheard. Sha'aban="collecting,"
dispersing, ruining, because the tribal wars recommenced: Ramazan
(intensely hot) has been explained and Shawwal (No. 10) derives
from Shaul (elevating) when the he-camels raise their tails in
rut. Zu'l-Ka'adah, the sedentary, is the rest time of the year,
when fighting is forbidden and Zu'l-Hijjah explains itself as the
pilgrimage-month.

[FN#427] The lowest of the seven.

[FN#428] Koran xxxvii. 5.

[FN#429] Arab. "Faylasuf," an evident corruption from the Greek.
Amongst the vulgar it denotes a sceptic, an atheist; much the
same a "Frammasun" or Freemason. The curious reader will consult
the Dabistan, vol. iii. chapt. xi. p. 138 et seq. "On the
Religion of the Wise" (philosophi), and, Beaconsfield's theft
from Shaftesbury.

[FN#430] Koran xxxvi. 37-38.

[FN#431] Koran xxii. 7. The Hour i.e. of Judgment.

[FN#432] Koran xx. 58. The Midrasch Tanchumah on Exod. vii. gives
a similar dialogue between Pharaoh and Moses. (Rodwell, in loco.)

[FN#433] Arab. "Sham'un" or "Shim'un," usually applied to Simon
Peter (as in Acts xv. 14). But the text alludes to Saint Simeon
(Luke ii. 25-35). See Gospel of Infancy (ii. 8) and especially
the Gospel of Nicodemus (xii. 3) which makes him a High-Priest.

[FN#434] Salih the Patriarch's she-camel, miraculously produced
from the rock in order to convert the Thamud-tribe. (Koran vii.)

[FN#435] When Abu Bakr was hiding with Mohammed in a cave on the
Hill Al-Saur (Thaur or Thur, Pilgrimage ii. 131) South of Meccah,
which must not be confounded with the cave on Jabal Hira now
called Jabal Nur on the way to Arafat (Pilgrimage iii. 246), the
fugitives were protected by a bird which built her nest at the
entrance (according to another legend it was curtained by a
spider's web), whilst another bird (the crow of whom I shall
presently speak) tried to betray them. The first bird is
popularly supposed to have been a pigeon, and is referred to by
Hudibras,

     "Th' apostles of this fierce religion
     Like Mahomet, were ass and widgeon."

The ass I presume alludes to the marvellous beast Al-Burak which
the Greeks called         from      (Euthymius in Pocock, Spec.
A.H. p.144) and which Indian Moslems picture with human face,
ass's ears, equine body and peacock's wings and tail. The
"widgeon" I presume to be a mistake or a misprint for pigeon.

[FN#436] The Arabs are not satisfied with the comparative
moderation of the Hebrew miracle, and have added all manner of
absurdities. (Pilgrimage ii. 288.)

[FN#437] Koran lxxxi. 18. Sale translates "by the morning when it
appeareth;" and the word (tanaffus) will bear this meaning. Mr.
Rodwell prefers, "By the dawn when it clears away the darkness by
its breath."

[FN#438] As a rule Moslems are absurdly ignorant of arithmetic
and apparently cannot master it. Hence in Egypt they used Copts
for calculating-machines and further East Hindds. The mildest
numerical puzzle, like the above, is sure of success.

[FN#439] The paradiseal tree which supplied every want. Mohammed
borrowed it from the Christians (Rev. xxi. 10-21 and xxii. 1-2)
who placed in their paradise the Tree of Life which bears twelve
sorts of fruits and leaves of healing virtue. (See also the 3rd
book of Hermas, his Similitudes.) The Hebrews borrowed it from
the Persians. Amongst the Hindus it appears as "Kalpavriksha;"
amongst the Scandinavians as Yggdrasil. The curious reader will
consult Mr. James Fergusson's learned work, "Tree and Serpent
Worship," etc. London, 1873.

[FN#440] Aaron's Rod becomes amongst Moslems (Koran vii. 110)
Moses' Staff; the size being that of a top-mast. (Pilgrimage i.
300, 301.) In Koran xx. 18, 19, we find a notice of its uses; and
during the Middle Ages it reappeared in the Staff of Wamba the
Goth (A.D.672-680) the witch's broomstick was its latest
development.

[FN#441] Christ, say the Eutychians, had only one nature, the
divine; so he was crucified in effigy.

[FN#442] Jesus is compared with Adam in the Koran (chapt. iii.):
his titles are Kalamu 'llah (word of God) because engendered
without a father, and Ruhu 'llah (breath of God) because
conceived by Gabriel in the shape of a beautifui youth breathing
into the Virgin's vulva. Hence Moslems believe in a "miraculous
conception" and consequently determine that one so conceived was,
like Elias and Khizr, not subject to death; they also hold him
born free from "original sin" (a most sinful superstition), a
veil being placed before the Virgin and Child against the Evil
One who could not touch them. He spoke when a babe in cradle; he
performed miracles of physic; he was taken up to Heaven; he will
appear as the forerunner of Mohammed on the White Tower of
Damascus, and finally he will be buried at Al-Medinah. The Jews
on the other hand speak of him as "that man:" they hold that he
was begotten by Joseph during the menstrual period and therefore
a born magician. Moreover he learned the Sham ha-maphrash or
Nomen tetragrammaton, wrote it on parchment and placed it in an
incision in his thigh, which closed up on the Name being
mentioned (Buxtorf, Lex Talmud, 25-41). Other details are given
in the Toldoth Jesu (Historia Joshuae Nazareni). This note should
be read by the eminent English litterateur who discovered a fact,
well known to Locke and Carlyle, that "Mohammedans are
Christians." So they are and something more.

[FN#444] A fair specimen of the riddle known as the "surprise."

[FN#445] Koran xli. 10.

[FN#446] Koran xxxvi. 82.

[FN#447] Here we enter upon a series of disputed points. The
Wahhabis deny the intercession of the Apostle (Pilgrimage ii.
76-77). The Shi'ahs place Ali next in dignity to Mohammed and
there is a sect (Ali-Ilahi) which believes him to be an Avatar or
incarnation of the Deity. For the latter the curious reader will
consult the "Dabistan," ii. 451. The Koran by its many
contradictions seems to show that Mohammed never could make up
his own mind on the subject, thinking himself at times an
intercessor and then sharply denying all intercession.

[FN#448] Arab. "Kanjifah"=a pack of cards; corrupted from the
Persian "Ganjifah." We know little concerning the date or origin
of this game in the East, where the packs are quite unlike ours.

[FN#449] It is interesting to compare this account with the
pseudo Ovid and with Tale clxvi. in Gesta "Of the game of
Schaci." Its Schacarium is the chess-board. Rochus (roccus, etc.)
is not from the Germ. Rock (a coat) but from Rukh (Pers. a hero,
a knight-errant) Alphinus (Ital. Alfino) is Al-Firzan (Pers.
science, wise).

[FN#450] Arab, "Baydak" or "Bayzak"; a corruption of the Persian
"Piyadah"=a footman, peon, pawn; and proving whence the Arabs
derived the game. The Persians are the readiest
backgammon-players known to me, better even than the Greeks; they
throw the dice from the hand and continue foully abusing the
fathers and mothers of the "bones" whilst the game lasts. It is
often played in the intervals of dinner by the higher classes in
Persia.

[FN#451] Metaphor from loading camels and mules. To "eat" a piece
is to take it.

[FN#452] Arab. "Bilabil"; a plural of "Bulbul" with a double
entendre balabil (plur. of ballalah)=heart's troubles, and "bala,
bul"=a calamity, nay, etc. 

[FN#453] The popular English idea of the Arab horse is founded
upon utter unfact. Book after book tells us, "There are three
distinct breeds of Arabians -the Attechi, a very superior breed;
the Kadishi, mixed with these and of little value; and the
Kochlani, highly prized and very difficult to procure." "Attechi"
may be At-Tazi (the Arab horse, or hound) or some confusion with
"At" (Turk.) a horse. "Kadish" (Gadish or Kidish) is a nag; a
gelding, a hackney, a "pacer" (generally called "Rahwan").
"Kochlani" is evidently "Kohlani," the Kohl-eyed, because the
skin round the orbits is dark as if powdered. This is the true
blue blood; and the bluest of all is "Kohlani al-Ajuz" (of the
old woman) a name thus accounted for. An Arab mare dropped a
filly when in flight; her rider perforce galloped on and
presently saw the foal appear in camp, when it was given to an
old woman for nursing and grew up to be famous. The home of the
Arab horse is the vast plateau of Al-Najd: the Tahamah or lower
maritime regions of Arabia, like Malabar, will not breed good
beasts. The pure blood all descends from five collateral lines
called Al-Khamsah (the Cinque). Literary and pedantic Arabs
derive them from the mares of Mohammed, a native of the dry and
rocky region, Al-Hijaz, whither horses are all imported. Others
go back (with the Koran, chapt. xxviii.) to Solomon, possibly
Salman, a patriarch fourth in descent from Ishmael and some 600
years older than the Hebrew King. The Badawi derive the five from
Rabi'at al-Faras (R. of the mare) fourth in descent from Adnan,
the fount of Arab genealogy. But they differ about the names:
those generally given are Kahilan (Kohaylat), Saklawi (which the
Badawin pronounce Saglawi), Abayan, and Hamdani; others
substitute Manakhi (the long-maned), Tanis and Jalfun. These
require no certificate amongst Arabs; for strangers a simple
statement is considered enough. The Badawin despise all
half-breeds (Arab sires and country mares), Syrian, Turkish,
Kurdish and Egyptian. They call these (first mentioned in the
reign of Ahmes, B.C. 1600) the "sons of horses"; as opposed to
"sons of mares," or thorough-breds. Nor do they believe in
city-bred animals. I have great doubts concerning our old English
sires, such as the Darley Arabian which looks like a Kurdish
half-bred, the descendant of those Cappadocians so much prized by
the Romans: in Syria I rode a "Harfushi" (Kurd) the very image of
it. There is no difficulty in buying Arab stallions except the
price. Of course the tribe does not like to part with what may
benefit the members generally; but offers of œ500 to œ1,000 would
overcome men's scruples. It is different with mares, which are
almost always the joint property of several owners. The people
too dislike to see a hat on a thorough-bred mare: "What hast thou
done that thou art ridden by that ill-omened Kafir?" the Badawin
used to mutter when they saw a highly respectable missionary at
Damascus mounting a fine Ruwala mare. The feeling easily explains
the many wars about horses occurring in Arab annals, e.g. about
Dahis and Ghabra. (C. de Perceval, Essas, vol.ii.)

[FN#454] The stricter kind of Eastern Jew prefers to die on the
floor, not in bed, as was the case with the late Mr. Emmanuel
Deutsch, who in his well-known article on the Talmud had the
courage to speak of "Our Saviour." But as a rule the Israelite,
though he mostly appears as a Deist, a Unitarian, has a fund of
fanatical feelings which crop up in old age and near death. The
"converts" in Syria and elsewhere, whose Judaism is intensified
by "conversion," when offers are made to them by the missionaries
repair to the Khakham (scribe) and, after abundant wrangling
determine upon a modus vivendi. They are to pay a proportion of
their wages, to keep careful watch in the cause of Israel and to
die orthodox. In Istria there is a legend of a Jew Prior in a
convent who was not discovered till he announced himself most
unpleasantly on his death-bed. For a contrary reason to Jewish
humility, the Roman Emperors preferred to die standing.

[FN#455] He wished to die in a state of ceremonial purity; as has
before been mentioned.

[FN#456] Arab. "Badal": in Sind (not to speak of other places) it
was customary to hire a pauper "badal" to be hanged in stead of a
rich man. Sir Charles Napier signed many a death-warrant before
he ever heard of the practice.

[FN#457] Arab. "La'an" = curse. The word is in every mouth though
strongly forbidden by religion. Even of the enemies of Al-Islam
the learned say, "Ila'an Yezid wa la tazid" = curse Yezid but do
not exceed (i.e. refrain from cursing the others). This, however,
is in the Shafi'i school and the Hanafis do not allow it
(Pilgrimage i. 198). Hence the Moslem when scrupulous uses na'al
(shoe) for la'an (curse) as Ina'al abuk (for Ila'an abu'-k) or,
drat (instead of damn) your father. Men must hold Supreme
Intelligence to be of feeble kind if put off by such miserable
pretences.

[FN#458] Koran vi. 44, speaking of the Infidels. It is a most
unamiable chapter, with such assertions as "Allah leadeth into
error whom He pleaseth," etc.

[FN#459] Alluding to the "formication" which accompanies a stroke

[FN#460] Pronounce Zool Karnayn.

[FN#461] i.e. the Koranic and our mediaeval Alexander, Lord of
the two Horns (East and West) much "Matagrobolized" and very
different from him of Macedon. The title is variously explained,
from two protuberances on his head or helm, from two long locks
and, possibly, from the ram-horns of Jupiter Ammon. The anecdote
in the text seems suggested by the famous interview (probably a
canard) with Diogenes: see in the Gesta, Tale cxlvi., "The answer
of Diomedes the Pirate to Alexander." Iskandar was originally
called Marzban (Lord of the Marches), son of Marzabah; and,
though descended from Yunan, son of Japhet, the eponymus of the
Greeks, was born obscure, the son of an old woman. According to
the Persians he was the son of the Elder Darab (Darius Codomannus
of the Kayanian or Second dynasty), by a daughter of Philip of
Macedon; and was brought up by his grandfather. When Abraham and
Isaac had rebuilt the Ka'abah they foregathered with him and
Allah sent him forth against the four quarters of the earth to
convert men to the faith of the Friend or to cut their throats;
thus he became one of the four world-conquerors with Nimrod,
Solomon, Bukht al-Nasr (Nabochodonosor); and he lived down two
generations of men. His Wazir was Aristu (the Greek Aristotle)
and he carried a couple of flags, white and black, which made day
and night for him and facilitated his conquests. At the end of
Persia, where he was invited by the people, on account of the
cruelty of his half brother Darab II., he came upon two huge
mountains on the same line, behind which dwelt a host of
abominable pygmies, two spans high, with curious eyes, ears which
served as mattresses and coverlets, huge fanged mouths, lions'
claws and hairy hind quarters. They ate men, destroyed
everything, copulated in public and had swarms of children. These
were Yajuj and Majuj (Gog and Magog) descendants of Japhet.
Sikandar built against them the famous wall with stones cemented
and riveted by iron and copper. The "Great Wall" of China, the
famous bulwark against the Tartars, dates from B.C. 320
(Alexander of Macedon died B.C. 324); and as the Arabs knew
Canton well before Mohammed's day, they may have built their
romance upon it. The Guebres consigned Sikandar to hell for
burning the Nusks or sections of the Zendavesta.

[FN#462] These terrific preachments to Eastern despots (who
utterly ignore them) are a staple produce of Oriental
tale-literature and form the chiaro-oscuro, as it were, of a
picture whose lights are brilliant touches of profanity and
indelicate humour. It certainly has the charm of contrast. Much
of the above is taken from the Sikandar-nameh (Alexander Book) of
the great Persian poet, Nizami, who flourished A.H. 515-597,
between the days of Firdausi (ob. A.D.1021) and Sa'adi (ob. A.D.
1291). In that romance Sikandar builds, "where the sun goes
down," a castle of glittering stone which kills men by causing
excessive laughter and surrounds it with yellow earth like gold.
Hence the City of Brass. He also converts, instead of being
converted by, the savages of the text. He finds a stone of
special excellence which he calls Almas (diamond); and he obtains
it from the Valley of Serpents by throwing down flesh to the
eagles. Lastly he is accompanied by "Bilinas" or "Bilinus," who
is apparently Apollonius of Tyana.

[FN#463] I have explained the beautiful name in Night cclxxxix:
He is stil famous for having introduced into Persia the fables of
Pilpay (Bidyapati, the lord of lore) and a game which the genius
of Persia developed into chess. 

[FN#464] Here we find an eternal truth, of which Malthusians ever
want reminding; that the power of a nation simply consists in its
numbers of fighting men and in their brute bodily force. The
conquering race is that which raises most foot-pounds: hence the
North conquers the South in the Northern hemisphere and visa
versa.

[FN#465] Arab. "Wayha," not so strong as "Woe to," etc. Al-Hariri
often uses it as a formula of affectionate remonstrance.

[FN#466] As a rule (much disputed) the Sayyid is a descendant
from Mohammed through his grandchild Hasan, and is a man of the
pen; whereas the Sharif derives from Husayn and is a man of the
sword. The Najib al-taraf is the son of a common Moslemah by a
Sayyid, as opposed to the "Najib al-tarafayn," when both parents
are of Apostolic blood. The distinction is not noticed in Lane's
"Modern Egyptians". The Sharif is a fanatic and often dangerous,
as I have instanced in Pilgrimage iii. 132.

[FN#467] A theologian of Bassorah (eighth century): surnamed Abu
Yahya. The prayer for mercy denotes that he was dead when the
tale was written.

[FN#468] A theologian of Bassorah (eighth century).

[FN#469] Arab. "Musalla"; lit. a place of prayer; an oratory, a
chapel, opp. to "Jami'" = a (cathedral) mosque.

[FN#470] According to all races familiar with the negro, a calf
like a shut fist planted close under the ham is, like the
"cucumber shin" and "lark heel", a good sign in a slave. Shapely
calves and well-made legs denote the idle and the ne'er-do-well.
I have often found this true although the rule is utterly
empirical. Possibly it was suggested by the contrast of the
nervous and lymphatic temperaments.

[FN#471] These devotees address Allah as a lover would his
beloved. The curious reader will consult for instances the
Dabistan on Tasawwuf (ii. 221; i.,iii. end, and passim).

[FN#472] Arab. "Ma'rifat," Pers. Danish; the knowledge of the
Truth. The seven steps are (1) Shari'at, external law like night;
(2) Tarikat, religious rule like the stars; (3) Hakikat, reality,
truth like the moon; (4) Ma'arifat like the sun; (5) Kurbat,
proximity to Allah; (6) Wasilat, union with Allah, and (7)
Suknat, dwelling in Allah. (Dabistan iii.29.)

[FN#473] Name of a fountain of Paradise: See Night xlix., vol.
ii., p.100.

[FN#474] Arab. "Atbak"; these trays are made of rushes, and the
fans of palm-leaves or tail-feathers. 

[FN#475] Except on the two great Festivals when fasting is
forbidden. The only religion which has shown common sense in this
matter is that of the Guebres or Parsis: they consider fasting
neither meritorious nor lawful; and they honour Hormuzd by good
living "because it keeps the soul stronger." Yet even they have
their food superstitions, e.g. in Gate No. xxiv.: "Beware of sin
specially on the day thou eatest flesh, for flesh is the diet of
Ahriman." And in India the Guebres have copied the Hindus in not
slaughtering horned cattle for the table.

[FN#476] Arab. "Jallabiyah," a large-sleeved robe of coarse stuff
worn by the poor.

[FN#477] His fear was that his body might be mutilated by the
fall.

[FN#478] The phrase means "offering up many and many a prayer."

[FN#479] A saying of Mohammed is recorded "Al-fakru fakhri"
(poverty is my pride!), intelligible in a man who never wanted
for anything. Here he is diametrically opposed to Ali who
honestly abused poverty; and the Prophet seems to have borrowed
from Christendom, whose "Lazarus and Dives" shows a man sent to
Hell because he enjoyed a very modified Heaven in this life and
which suggested that one of the man's greatest miseries is an
ecclesiastical virtue--"Holy Poverty"--represented in the Church
as a bride young and lovely. If a "rich man can hardly enter the
kingdom" what must it be with a poor man whose conditions are far
more unfavourable? Going to the other extreme we may say that
Poverty is the root of all evil and the more so as it curtails
man's power of benefiting others. Practically I observe that
those who preach and praise it the most, practise it the least
willingly: the ecclesiastic has always some special reasons, a
church or a school is wanted; but not the less he wishes for more
money. In Syria this Holy Poverty leads to strange abuses. At
Bayrut I recognised in most impudent beggers well-to-do peasants
from the Kasrawan district, and presently found out that whilst
their fields were under snow they came down to the coast, enjoyed
a genial climate and lived on alms. When I asked them if they
were not ashamed to beg, they asked me if I was ashamed of
following in the footsteps of the Saviour and Apostles. How much
wiser was Zoroaster who found in the Supreme Paradise
(Minuwan-minu) "many persons, rich in gold and silver who had
worshipped the Lord and had been grateful to Him." (Dabistan i.
265.)

[FN#480] Koran vii. 52.

[FN#481] Arab. "Al-bayt" = the house. The Arabs had probably
learned this pleasant mode of confinement from the Chinese whose
Kea or Cangue is well known. The Arabian form of it is "Ghull,"
or portable pillory, which reprobates will wear on Judgment Day.

[FN#482] This commonest conjuring trick in the West becomes a
miracle in the credulous East.

[FN#483] Arab. "Kanun"; the usual term is Mankal (pron. Mangal) a
pan of copper or brass. Some of these "chafing-dishes" stand four
feet high and are works of art. Lane (M.E. chapt. iv) gives an
illustration of the simpler kind, together with the "Aziki," a
smaller pan for heating coffee. See Night dxxxviii.

[FN#484] See vol. iii., p.239. The system is that of the Roman As
and Unciae. Here it would be the twenty-fourth part of a dinar or
miskal; something under 5d. I have already noted that all Moslem
rulers are religiously bound to some handicraft, if it be only
making toothpicks. Mohammed abolished kingship proper as well as
priestcraft.

[FN#485] Al-Islam, where salvation is found under the shade of
the swords.

[FN#486] Moslems like the Classics (Aristotle and others) hold
the clitoris (Zambur) to be the sedes et scaturigo veneris which,
says Sonnini, is mere profanity. In the babe it protrudes beyond
the labiae and snipping off the head forms female circumcision.
This rite is supposed by Moslems to have been invented by Sarah
who so mutilated Hagar for jealousy and was afterwards ordered by
Allah to have herself circumcised at the same time as Abraham. It
is now (or should be) universal in Al-Islam and no Arab would
marry a girl "unpurified" by it. Son of an "uncircumcised" mother
(Ibn al-bazra) is a sore insult. As regards the popular idea that
Jewish women were circumcised till the days of Rabbi Gershom
(A.D.1000) who denounced it as a scandal to the Gentiles, the
learned Prof. H. Graetz informs me, with some indignation, that
the rite was never practised and that the great Rabbi contended
only against polygamy. Female circumcision, however, is I believe
the rule amongst some outlying tribes of Jews. The rite is the
proper complement of male circumcision, evening the sensitiveness
of the genitories by reducing it equally in both sexes: an
uncircumcised woman has the venereal orgasm much sooner and
oftener than a circumcised man, and frequent coitus would injure
her health; hence I believe, despite the learned historian, that
it is practised by some Eastern Jews. "Excision" is universal
amongst the negroids of the Upper Nile (Werne), the Somal and
other adjacent tribes. The operator, an old woman, takes up the
instrument, a knife or razor-blade fixed into a wooden handle,
and with three sweeps cuts off the labia and the head of the
clitoris. The parts are then sewn up with a packneedle and a
thread of sheepskin; and in Dar-For a tin tube is inserted for
the passage of urine. Before marriage the bridegroom trains
himself for a month on beef, honey and milk; and, if he can open
his bride with the natural weapon, he is a sworder to whom no
woman in the tribe can deny herself. If he fails, he tries
penetration with his fingers and by way of last resort whips out
his whittle and cuts the parts open. The sufferings of the first
few nights must be severe. The few Somali prostitutes who
practised at Aden always had the labiae and clitoris excised and
the skin showing the scars of coarse sewing. The moral effect of
female circumcision is peculiar. While it diminishes the heat of
passion it increases licentiousness, and breeds a debauchery of
mind far worse than bodily unchastity, because accompanied by a
peculiar cold cruelty and a taste for artificial stimulants to
"luxury." It is the sexlessness of a spayed canine imitated by
the suggestive brain of humanity.

[FN#487] Koran vi. So called because certain superstitions about
Cattle are therein mentioned.

[FN#488] Koran iv. So called because it treats of marriages,
divorces, etc. 

[FN#489] Sidi (contracted from Sayyidi = my lord) is a title
still applied to holy men in Marocco and the Maghrib; on the East
African coast it is assumed by negro and negroid Moslems, e.g.
Sidi Mubarak Bombay; and "Seedy boy" is the Anglo-Indian term for
a Zanzibar-man. "Khawwas" is one who weaves palm-leaves (Khos)
into baskets, mats, etc.: here, however, it may be an inherited
name.

[FN#490] i.e. in spirit; the "strangers yet" of poor dear Richard
Monckton Milnes, Lord Houghton.

[FN#491] Al-Hakk = the Truth, one of the ninety-nine names of
Allah.

[FN#492] The Moslem is still unwilling to address Salam (Peace be
with you) to the Christian, as it is obligatory (Farz) to a
Moslem (Koran, chapt. iv. and lxviii.). He usually evades the
difficulty by saluting the nearest Moslem or by a change of words
Allah Yahdi-k (Allah direct thee to the right way) or "Peace be
upon us and the righteous worshipers of Allah" (not you) or
Al-Samm (for Salam) alayka = poison to thee. The idea is old:
Alexander of Alexandria in his circular letter describes the
Arian heretics as "men whom it is not lawful to salute or to bid
God-speed."

[FN#493] Koran xxxvi. 82. I have before noted that this famous
phrase was borrowed from the Hebrews, who borrowed it from the
Egyptians.

[FN#494] The story of Moses and Khizr has been noticed before.
See Koran chapt. xviii. 64 et seq. It is also related, says Lane
(ii. 642), by Al-Kazwini in the Ajaib al-Makhlukat. This must be
"The Angel and the Hermit" in the Gesta Romanorum, Tale lxxx.
which possibly gave rise to Parnell's Hermit; and Tale cxxvii.
"Of Justice and Equity." The Editor says it "contains a beautiful
lesson:" I can find only excellent excuses for "doing evil that
good may come of it."

[FN#498]  In Sufistical parlance, the creature is the lover and
the Creator the Beloved: worldly existence is Disunion, parting,
severance; and the life to come is Reunion. The basis of the idea
is the human soul being a divinae particula aurae, a disjoined
molecule from the Great Spirit, imprisoned in a jail of flesh;
and it is so far valuable that it has produced a grand and
pathetic poetry; but Common Sense asks, Where is the proof? And
Reason wants to know, What does it all mean?

[FN#501] Arabs note two kinds of leprosy, "Bahak" or "Baras" the
common or white, and "Juzam" the black leprosy; the leprosy of
the joints, mal rouge. Both are attributed to undue diet as
eating fish and drinking milk; and both are treated with tonics,
especially arsenic. Leprosy is regarded by Moslems as a
Scriptural malady on account of its prevalence amongst the
Israelites who, as Manetho tells us, were expelled from Egypt
because they infected and polluted the population. In mediaeval
Christendom an idea prevailed that the Saviour was a leper; hence
the term "morbus sacer"; the honours paid to the sufferers by
certain Saints and the Papal address (Clement III. A.D.1189)
dilectis filiis leprosis. (Farrar's Life of Christ, i.149.) For
the "disgusting and impetuous lust" caused by leprosy, see
Sonnini (p.560) who visited the lepers at Canea in Candia. He is
one of many who describes this symptom; but in the Brazil, where
the foul malady still prevails, I never heard of it.

[FN#502] A city in Irak; famous for the three days' battle which
caused the death of Yezdegird, last Sassanian king.

[FN#503] A mountain pass near Meccah famous for the "First Fealty
of the Steep" (Pilgrimage ii. 126). The mosque was built to
commemorate the event.

[FN#504] To my surprise I read in Mr. Redhouse's "Mesnevi"
(Trubner, 1881), "Arafat, the mount where the victims are
slaughtered by the pilgrims." (p.60). This ignorance is
phenomenal. Did Mr. Redhouse never read Burckhardt or Burton?

[FN#505] i.e. listening to the sermon. 

[FN#506] It is sad doggrel. 

[FN#507] This long story, containing sundry episodes and
occupying fifty-three Nights, is wholly omitted by Lane (ii. 643)
because "it is a compound of the most extravagant absurdities."
He should have enabled his readers to form their own judgment.

[FN#508] Called Jamasp (brother and minister of the ancient
Persian King Gushtasp) in the translations of Trebutien and
others from Von Hammer.

[FN#509] The usual term of lactation in the East, prolonged to
two years and a-half, which is considered the rule laid down by
the Shara' or precepts of the Prophet. But it is not unusual to
see children of three and even four years hanging to their
mothers' breasts. During this period the mother does not cohabit
with her husband; the separation beginning with her pregnancy.
Such is the habit, not only of the "lower animals," but of all
ancient peoples, the Egyptians (from whom the Hebrews borrowed
it), the Assyrians and the Chinese. I have discussed its bearing
upon pregnancy in my "City of the Saints": the Mormons insist
upon this law of purity being observed; and the beauty, strength
and good health of the younger generation are proofs of their
wisdom.

[FN#510] Thus distinguishing it from "Asal-kasab," cane honey or
sugar. See vol. i., 271.

[FN#511] The student of Hinduism will remember the Naga-Kings and
Queens (Melusines and Echidnae) who guard the earth-treasures in
Naga-land. The first appearance of the snake in literature is in
Egyptian hieroglyp
